		<description><![CDATA[What was the soul crushing fiasco?  I&#039;m planning on shipping my vehicle home once done in South America ... I&#039;m hoping my soul survives intact :)

On a related note, the folks who bought your truck mentioned it was registered as non-op in California.  My registration is up and I&#039;m leaving soon.  I&#039;d like to go for a cheap non-op registration as well.  Did that pose any problems with vehicle import anywhere in Latin America?  Mexico, at least, seems to require current registration (whatever that means), according to some reports.

Thanks for the insight.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey Bob, our visit to Scottsdale will be a bit of a whirl wind with everything we plan on doing and visiting everybody we plan on seeing. But if it works out we can definitely grab a drink and unload a bit of info.  We won&#039;t yet have a phone while we visit but you can email us at &#117;&#115;&#064;&#097;&#103;&#114;&#111;&#111;&#116;&#115;&#046;&#099;&#111;&#109;. 

We&#039;ll be in town from 3/27-4/1
