		<description><![CDATA[True, true true, true.

Understanding the language will turn the trip from &quot;being on the outside looking in&quot; to really being a part of the land, culture, and people. We thought we would just figure it out as we went, we were sadly mistaken. Many missed opportunies in Mexico, We are taking a month here in Guatemala to work on our spanish and &quot;hopefully&quot; understand/converse un poco mas with the locals. 

Hopefully your article will convince your readers to study and work on spanish BEFORE the trip. Even a little bit will be worth its weight in oro.]]></description>
