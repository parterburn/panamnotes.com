		<description><![CDATA[We have run into a bit trouble. The summer season in Patagonia means gas lines, shortages, and rations. Not all bad however, the gas is subsidized in this region of Patagonia. 
We map gas stations ahead of time via our GPS software and paper map which has a gas station icon near towns with them. This helps but we find there are many stations down here that don&#039;t have gas most of the time or are boarded-up.  Worst case scenario is that you just camp out an extra day and wait for the truck to come in.
