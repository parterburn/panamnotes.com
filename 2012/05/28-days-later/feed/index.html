		<description><![CDATA[Hey guys! It&#039;s your former Mendoza biking mates Nick &amp; Rachel here. We have been home for 32 days now too so it was cool to read about your &quot;re-integration&quot;. We are going through it now, it has it&#039;s highs and lows for us, but it sounds like you are really happy are assimilating nicely so there&#039;s probably hope for us ;)  I assume you have adjusted to showering indoors and are not still showering nekkid under the stars in front of your new neighbors (unless that&#039;s normal in Nebraska, could be for all we know...) Anywho, take care you crazy kids. Glad we were able to share a piece of the adventure with you!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[We enjoyed following along near the end of your adventure.  We&#039;re anxious to visit the lakes in Argentina where you spent your last days.  Sounds incredible!  One more peaceful and serene place before we plunge into Asia!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Wonder if you realize that you are both guilty of polluting many minds with aspirations and lofty journeys..

We can only thank you for your self less contribution to the world of freedom and the rainbows of ones mind.

Wishing you a joyous and worthy life together.
