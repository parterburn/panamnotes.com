				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Overland advice series, 10 of 10. Neither of us are medical professionals. What follows are our amateur observations. Consult your doctor before making a decision.</em></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Malaria</span></p>
<ul>
<li>The majority of Westerners driving the PanAm do not take prophylactic medicine for Malaria.</li>
<li>We never encountered a local who was taking a prophylactic for Malaria..</li>
<li>We found Doxycycline (Spanish: Doxiciclina) to be the most commonly used. It is a broad spectrum antibiotic taken daily.</li>
<li>Doxy and other Malaria medication can be purchased over-the-counter in most of Latin America</li>
<li>Brianna was on Doxy for much of the trip and had no noticeable side effects. Logan did not take a prophylactic but carried a month supply of Doxy to take if symptoms appeared.</li>
<li>Most of Central America is chloroquine-sensitive. Meaning these countries have a strain of Malaria resistant to the anti-malarial drug chloroquine.</li>
<li>There is no prophylactic that is 100% effective. There is not one particular medication that is regarded as the best. All of them have a long list of pros and cons.</li>
<li>Mosquito deterrents (DEET spay, netting, gin and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonic_water" target="_blank">tonics</a>) are your best defense.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Immunizations</span></p>
<p>We had the following immunizations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Yellow Fever &#8211; for which you will receive a yellow card that may be required to enter various countries in South America.</li>
<li>Hepatitis A</li>
<li>Hepatitis B</li>
<li>Typhoid</li>
<li>Rabies</li>
<li>Tetnis (Tdap)</li>
</ul>
<div id="attachment_3313" style="width: 435px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/IMG_4890.jpg" rel="shadowbox[sbpost-3309];player=img;" title="What's up doc?"><img class="size-custom0 wp-image-3313" title="What's up doc?" src="http://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/IMG_4890-425x284.jpg" alt="" width="425" height="284" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Paying a visit to the Emergency Room in Tamarindo</p></div>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">First Aid</span></p>
<p>Carrying a first aid kit is a must but the contents and size of your kit will vary depending on your needs. We have the ‘2 person multiple days’ kit from <a href="http://www.adventuremedicalkits.com/products.php?cat=5" target="_blank">Adventure Medical Kits</a>, a popular company among wilderness explorers. Our kit includes a 200 page manual on Wilderness &amp; Travel Medicine. For our needs a guidebook to accompany the first aid equipment was a must.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Additional Medication</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Birth control pills can be purchased cheaply and easily in Latin America compared to the US. As low as $1 a month in Bolivia.</li>
<li>Ciprofloxacin (CIPRO): An antibiotic typically used to treat diarrhea or bacterial dysentery. Our doctor set us up with 20 tablets to use at our discretion.</li>
<li>Acetazolamide (DIAMOX): used to speed your acclimation to high altitude. We carried some along as our driving altitude exceeded 15,000 feet on several occasions. It was never needed.</li>
<li>We carried the following to supplement our first aid kit: Aspirin, Ibuprofen, stomach acid reducers, band-aids, freezer pack, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Consultation</span></p>
<p>In Latin America the pharmacist plays an active role in diagnosing ailments. When faced with a medical situation beyond our control we always sought the assistance of the town pharmacist first. When Logan had the metal sliver embedded in <a href="http://panamnotes.com/2011/03/medico/" target="_blank">his eye</a>, the pharmacist phoned ahead to ensure the English-speaking doctor was in and could handle the case.</p>
<div id="attachment_3312" style="width: 435px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/10-8-Upload-116.jpg" rel="shadowbox[sbpost-3309];player=img;" title="Out There"><img class="size-custom0 wp-image-3312" title="Out There" src="http://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/10-8-Upload-116-425x284.jpg" alt="" width="425" height="284" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">A long ways away from any medical facility</p></div>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Insurance</span></p>
<p>We used <a href="http://www.worldnomads.com/" target="_blank">World Nomad insurance</a>. The majority of unemployed long-term travelers we asked were on this same plan as it is endorsed by Lonely Planet. Their insurance covers the very basics for emergency health, dental and evacuation. When visiting doctors or dentists our bills were always well under the $500 deductible, so we never had to file a claim.</p>
<p>In addition to health insurance we took out a policy with <a href="http://www.findmespot.com/en/index.php?cid=104" target="_blank">GEOS</a> in conjunction with our Spot messenger. This insurance covers any search and rescue costs.</p>

<p>Spend a long weekend in Puerto Vallarta and it&#8217;s easy to believe you&#8217;ve mastered the Spanish language. The reality is you know how to order a beer and ask for the bathroom. That margarita weekend won&#8217;t get you far at the Guatemala border crossing.  The first step is to admit ignorance.</p>
<div id="attachment_3226" style="width: 180px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/be8f80b1-25e3-45b6-b398-02ba79d51725.jpg" rel="shadowbox[sbpost-2865];player=img;" title="Si!"><img class="size-full wp-image-3226" title="Si!" src="http://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/be8f80b1-25e3-45b6-b398-02ba79d51725.jpg" alt="" width="170" height="157" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Una mas cerveza por favor</p></div>
<p>How far you stretch your Spanish skills will determine how your trip will play out. It&#8217;s entirely possible to get by on the usual memorized phrases. But with an increased comfort level, your options for exploration expand enormously and as a bonus side effect, costs go down. When you find your organized campground no longer exists and you&#8217;re 200 miles from the next town, knowing how to ask if you can camp out behind a restaurant on the beach comes in pretty handy.</p>
<div id="attachment_3227" style="width: 459px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/IMG_7795.jpg" rel="shadowbox[sbpost-2865];player=img;" title="El Faro Mexico"><img class="size-small-feature wp-image-3227" title="El Faro Mexico" src="http://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/IMG_7795-449x300.jpg" alt="" width="449" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Out of options but not out of luck, camped out at a restaurant in Mexico</p></div>
<p>The best place to start is the city library. Leave all your notions of dusty encyclopedias at the door. During our year of PanAm preparation, the San Francisco public library offered Rosetta Stone online through their website. With my (free) library card, I was able to learn Spanish in my own living room, for free. Additionally, I made use of several other free language programs online through the library.</p>
<div id="attachment_3203" style="width: 209px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/RosettaStone.jpg" rel="shadowbox[sbpost-2865];player=img;" title="Rosetta Stone"><img class=" wp-image-3203 " title="Rosetta Stone" src="http://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/RosettaStone-284x284.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="199" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Famous for a reason, this program is solid</p></div>
<p>Most city colleges offer conversational Spanish courses each semester and they&#8217;re more affordable than private lessons. Order some phrase books (<a href="http://shop.lonelyplanet.com/mexico/mexican-spanish-phrasebook-2" target="_blank">Mexican Spanish</a> and <a href="http://shop.lonelyplanet.com/south-america/latin-american-spanish-phrasebook-5" target="_blank">Latin American Spanish</a> are great) and start practicing yesterday. If you&#8217;re a member of the Apple generation, don&#8217;t leave home without the <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/spanishdict/id332510494?mt=8" target="_blank">SpanishDict</a> app.</p>
<div id="attachment_3201" style="width: 435px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/IMG_8269.jpg" rel="shadowbox[sbpost-2865];player=img;" title="Cigar Factory Tour"><img class="size-custom0 wp-image-3201" title="Cigar Factory Tour" src="http://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/IMG_8269-425x284.jpg" alt="" width="425" height="284" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Spanish only tour of a cigar factory in Esteli, Nicaragua</p></div>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Spanish Lessons Learned</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Your tense will be wrong, you&#8217;ll conjugate the verb inappropriately, but just give it a shot. Effort goes a long way south of the border.</li>
<li>Listen. Don&#8217;t think about your answer before they&#8217;ve finished their statement.</li>
<li>Kids love to try out their English on you, this is a great way for you to try out your Spanish on them.</li>
<li>If you listen closely, native Spanish speakers will sometimes repeat back what you just said with corrections to your mistakes. Say thank you! Friendly corrections should be encouraged.</li>
<li>&#8220;Habla ingles?&#8221; should not exist in your personal lexicon of Spanish. If the person speaks English they&#8217;ll figure you out soon enough, otherwise struggle through, they appreciate it, and you need the practice.</li>
<li>The usted form is appreciated throughout Mexico and Central America but is considered too formal in South America.</li>
<li>The <em>vos</em> form is a fun reminder that everything you thought you knew changes in Argentina.</li>
<li>Guatemala and Bolivia are two of the most affordable countries to take Spanish lessons.  A private class with a university professor goes for about $6US/hour in Bolivia. Ask other overlanders for the latest recommendation.</li>
<li>Sometimes you just have to call a spade a spade and explain <em>no hablo español</em> when you&#8217;re out of your element. This often ends in a helpless shrug, a smile, and you&#8217;re on your way. But in Chile and Argentina you&#8217;ll find this statement roughly translates to, &#8220;I would love to hear you speak at length on this topic, but please speak as rapidly as possible from this point forward.&#8221; To be fair, it&#8217;s really odd for you to be in their country if you don&#8217;t speak the language.</li>
</ul>

<p>When planning we had a pretty good sense that bandits wouldn’t kidnap us, the truck frame wouldn’t snap nor would we disappear in the Nicaraguan jungle. But we knew from a bit of previous wandering south of the border that the police in Latin America can be corrupt.</p>
<p>One of the worst was in Ecuador where a young officer on a dirt bike led us down to a dark alley on the wrong side of town. <strong>He wore a black face-cover as he listed off his demands.</strong> In Honduras an officer holding a shotgun made the internationally recognized hand-gesture of ‘I’ll slit your throat’ before his comrade flagged us down at their road block.</p>
<div id="attachment_3195" style="width: 235px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Policia-peru.jpg" rel="shadowbox[sbpost-3191];player=img;" title="Policia Peru"><img class="size-medium wp-image-3195" title="Policia Peru" src="http://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Policia-peru-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Protect and serve</p></div>
<p>Over the last 13 months <strong>we’ve been stopped no less than 25 times</strong>. In some countries like Chile and El Salvador you’d be hard-pressed to find a corrupt cop. Even in places well known for corruption like Mexico and Honduras the majority of our stops involved no funny business.</p>
<p>Here’s our technique on dealing with the not-so-friendly stops:</p>
<ul>
<li>Don’t assume any stop will be corrupt. A warm smile and a well placed compliment of their country brings out the best in people. This is your best defense.</li>
<li>Carry the following items which are frequently requested: 3 safety triangles, fire extinguisher, and adhesive reflective tape. Also keep your headlights on at all times in Peru, Chile and Argentina.</li>
<li>Show them your easily replaceable AAA international drivers license. It’s many pages are in 10 languages and the stamps plus the passport photo make it look like a generic official document. Chances are they have never seen one and you can claim it is anything.</li>
<li>If they tell you that you have a fine, <em>infracion</em>, or <em>multa</em> simply state you don’t speak Spanish. The majority of them will give up realizing you’re not worth the hassle. In Peru we held elaborate two minute Spanish conversations with officers only to turn dumb when it came to understanding the fine. It worked like magic.</li>
<li>Never pay a fine on the spot. This is a bribe. In each country it is illegal for a police officer to accept or request money of any sort. Fines are typically paid at the nearest bank or police station.</li>
<li>Tell them you will take the ticket and pay it. It is extremely rare that they actually write you a ticket. Of the hundred PanAm overlanders we’ve met we know of exactly two tickets being issued. They will tell you anything (The bank is 100 miles in the opposite direction, our police station is closed today) to try and get you to pay them without writing up a ticket. Chances are the actual fine will be half of what they’re requesting.</li>
<li><strong>They will make up any infraction to get you to pay for their weekend bar tab</strong>. But even if you are in clear violation of the law (speeding, no insurance card) it is common to get off without paying.</li>
</ul>
<div>
<div id="attachment_3196" style="width: 248px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/CHIPS.jpg" rel="shadowbox[sbpost-3191];player=img;" title="CHIPS"><img class="size-medium wp-image-3196" title="CHIPS" src="http://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/CHIPS-238x300.jpg" alt="" width="238" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The style icons of he Honduras police force.</p></div>
</div>
<p>At a different stop in Honduras (half a mile down the road from the 1st) the cops had a well rehearsed good cop, bad cop routine. For 45 minutes the bad cop made threats while the good cop attempted to intervene for a small fee. At the end, both came over to shake our hands and send us off with a warm <em>buen viaje</em>!</p>
<p>Don’t sweat it. This is just a game to them adding spice to their otherwise boring day. <strong>Enjoy the show and remember your lines</strong>. It’s all part of the experience.</p>

<p>That was enough for us, we were going to give bush camping a shot.</p>
<div id="attachment_3130" style="width: 435px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/IMG_7707.jpg" rel="shadowbox[sbpost-2487];player=img;" title="Last stop in Baja before Mainland"><img class="size-custom0 wp-image-3130" title="Last stop in Baja before Mainland" src="http://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/IMG_7707-425x284.jpg" alt="" width="425" height="284" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Bush camp with company</p></div>
<p>Approaching the beach we shifted into four wheel drive and approached a small group of dispersed RVs and camper vans.  Popping up the camper we were sure to have the grizzly mace at the ready.  Over the next three days we bathed in the warm Sea of Cortez, hiked the nearby rock formations, even clinked Coronas.  It was second to none of any place we stayed in Mexico.</p>
<p>After that we rarely bush camped until Ecuador and that was a mistake.  We avoided it partly due to fear of the unknown and mostly not knowing how to go about it.</p>
<div id="attachment_3131" style="width: 435px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/IMG_8494.jpg" rel="shadowbox[sbpost-2487];player=img;" title="Colorful bush camp"><img class="size-custom0 wp-image-3131" title="Colorful bush camp" src="http://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/IMG_8494-425x284.jpg" alt="" width="425" height="284" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The Canyon del Pato, Peru</p></div>
<p>Bush camping by definition is camping without amenities or fees, anywhere you please.  Often we’ll find a nice covered overloook just down a back road or near a river.  Other times we pull just off the road in a rural area to break up a long drive.  Much of the time we get GPS coordinates from <a href="http://panamnotes.com/campsite-listing-south-america/" target="_blank">camping lists</a>.  Rather than a specific spot, coordinates give us an idea of those areas that are good for bush camping.</p>
<p>We never bush camp in or around urban areas, but know others do.  The countryside and small towns are more often than not <em>tranquillo</em>, but it never hurts to ask a local before settling down.</p>

<p>Turning off down an unmapped dirt road toward what might be a river, really gives you a feeling that you’re ‘out there.’  <strong>Looking back at our favorite routes through Peru and Ecuador, they could not be accomplished without the confidence and ability to camp where no man has camped before.</strong></p>
<p>Most scenic, quiet rest, picture perfect, and free; the way of the bush camp.  Waking up miles away from any hint of civilization is the overland way to start your day.</p>

<div id="attachment_3050" style="width: 435px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/IMG_7707.jpg" rel="shadowbox[sbpost-2963];player=img;" title="Baja Bush Camping"><img class="size-custom0 wp-image-3050" title="Baja Bush Camping" src="http://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/IMG_7707-425x284.jpg" alt="" width="425" height="284" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">On top of being free, bush camping is often the most scenic option</p></div>
<p>None-the-less, here it is to give you a rough idea:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mexico: $86 per day &#8211; the gas and delicious tacos were cheap but camping options all very expensive for Latin America.</li>
<li>Guatemala: $91 per day</li>
<li>El Salvador: $90 per day</li>
<li>Nicaragua: $96 per day</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: Costs above had us traveling at a faster rate and thus incurred higher costs. We slowed our roll in Costa Rica and the costs dropped. Costa Rica and Panama in reality are the most expensive countries in Central America. However, you’ll find that most overlanders slow down here and their costs too follow the same pattern.</p>
<ul>
<li>Costa Rica: $80 per day &#8211; camp and surf to your heart&#8217;s content and Costa Rica won’t be a budget breaker.</li>
<li>Panama: $78 per day &#8211; Spending two weeks just figuring out shipping kept costs low</li>
<li>Colombia: $99 per day &#8211; Shipping delays held us up in Panama and we had to speed through Colombia in order to meet up with friends flying into Ecuador. Fast = expensive.</li>
<li>Ecuador: $59 per day &#8211; gas here is only $1.48 per gallon!</li>
<li>Peru: $71 per day &#8211; This is the world’s fastest growing economy and the prices are rising accordingly</li>
<li>Bolivia: $49 per day &#8211; cheap gas, cheap everything (except booze), great bush camping. We loved it here.</li>
<li>Chile: TBD</li>
<li>Argentina: TBD</li>
</ul>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Cost of Gas by Country</span></p>
<p>Chart below shows the average cost in US dollars for one gallon of 85-87 octane gasoline by country. Taken over the duration of 2011.</p>
<ul>
<li>San Francisco, California: $3.90 (here for reference)</li>
<li>Mexico: $2.87 per gallon (subsidized for tourists and locals)</li>
<li>Guatemala: $4.11</li>
<li>El Salvador: $3.85</li>
<li>Nicaragua: $4.45</li>
<li>Costa Rica: $4.80</li>
<li>Panama: $3.65</li>
<li>Colombia: $4.67 (cheaper in Southern Colombia near border with Ecuador)</li>
<li>Ecuador: $1.48 (subsidized for tourists and locals)</li>
<li>Peru: $5.03</li>
<li>Bolivia: $2.02 (subsidized) $4.65/gallon (tourist price) Officially you are supposed to be charged the tourist price, but most of the time we got the subsidized price without even asking. The attendants don’t care as the stations are all state owned.</li>
<li>Chile: $5.35</li>
<li>Argentina: $4.62</li>
<li>Argentine Patagonia: $3.61 (subsided for tourists and locals)</li>
</ul>
