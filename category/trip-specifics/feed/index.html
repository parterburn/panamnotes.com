<div id="attachment_3050" style="width: 435px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/IMG_7707.jpg" rel="shadowbox[sbpost-2963];player=img;" title="Baja Bush Camping"><img class="size-custom0 wp-image-3050" title="Baja Bush Camping" src="http://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/IMG_7707-425x284.jpg" alt="" width="425" height="284" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">On top of being free, bush camping is often the most scenic option</p></div>
<p>None-the-less, here it is to give you a rough idea:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mexico: $86 per day &#8211; the gas and delicious tacos were cheap but camping options all very expensive for Latin America.</li>
<li>Guatemala: $91 per day</li>
<li>El Salvador: $90 per day</li>
<li>Nicaragua: $96 per day</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: Costs above had us traveling at a faster rate and thus incurred higher costs. We slowed our roll in Costa Rica and the costs dropped. Costa Rica and Panama in reality are the most expensive countries in Central America. However, you’ll find that most overlanders slow down here and their costs too follow the same pattern.</p>
<ul>
<li>Costa Rica: $80 per day &#8211; camp and surf to your heart&#8217;s content and Costa Rica won’t be a budget breaker.</li>
<li>Panama: $78 per day &#8211; Spending two weeks just figuring out shipping kept costs low</li>
<li>Colombia: $99 per day &#8211; Shipping delays held us up in Panama and we had to speed through Colombia in order to meet up with friends flying into Ecuador. Fast = expensive.</li>
<li>Ecuador: $59 per day &#8211; gas here is only $1.48 per gallon!</li>
<li>Peru: $71 per day &#8211; This is the world’s fastest growing economy and the prices are rising accordingly</li>
<li>Bolivia: $49 per day &#8211; cheap gas, cheap everything (except booze), great bush camping. We loved it here.</li>
<li>Chile: TBD</li>
<li>Argentina: TBD</li>
</ul>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Cost of Gas by Country</span></p>
<p>Chart below shows the average cost in US dollars for one gallon of 85-87 octane gasoline by country. Taken over the duration of 2011.</p>
<ul>
<li>San Francisco, California: $3.90 (here for reference)</li>
<li>Mexico: $2.87 per gallon (subsidized for tourists and locals)</li>
<li>Guatemala: $4.11</li>
<li>El Salvador: $3.85</li>
<li>Nicaragua: $4.45</li>
<li>Costa Rica: $4.80</li>
<li>Panama: $3.65</li>
<li>Colombia: $4.67 (cheaper in Southern Colombia near border with Ecuador)</li>
<li>Ecuador: $1.48 (subsidized for tourists and locals)</li>
<li>Peru: $5.03</li>
<li>Bolivia: $2.02 (subsidized) $4.65/gallon (tourist price) Officially you are supposed to be charged the tourist price, but most of the time we got the subsidized price without even asking. The attendants don’t care as the stations are all state owned.</li>
<li>Chile: $5.35</li>
<li>Argentina: $4.62</li>
<li>Argentine Patagonia: $3.61 (subsided for tourists and locals)</li>
</ul>

<p>Determining a long term budget for a trip like the PanAm is certainly the crux. Before this, our PanAm trip was still a wavering fantasy. Staring at the carefully crafted numbers was our moment of clarity, when we realized how attainable it truly was. These are our numbers to help you on your path to financial enlightenment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div id="attachment_2776" style="width: 435px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/IMG_1298.jpg" rel="shadowbox[sbpost-2760];player=img;" title="Dinero"><img class="size-custom0 wp-image-2776" title="Dinero" src="http://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/IMG_1298-425x284.jpg" alt="" width="425" height="284" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Fork it over</p></div>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Set-up costs</span></p>
<p>Probably the most variable of the cost categories, this is your truck and equipment.  Right now we&#8217;re parked in Northern Argentina next to a quarter of a million dollar Mercedes expedition camper.  Their tires cost more than our camper.  On the other end of the spectrum, we wanted to hit the road soon so we sought out the cheapest option without sacrificing reliability.  Additionally, we wanted a vehicle equipped to be lived in with 4WD.</p>
<p>No matter your price scale, nobody seems to come in <em>under</em> budget here.  These were our costs:</p>
<ul>
<li>2003 Toyota Tundra: $10,200</li>
<li>Taxes and registration: $984</li>
<li>New tires, tune-up &amp; maintenance: $3,013 for details click <a href="http://panamnotes.com/2011/03/toyota-tundra-expedition-prep/" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="http://panamnotes.com/2011/04/pop-up-camper-expedition-prep/" target="_blank">here</a></li>
<li>2007 Palomino camper: $5,200</li>
<li>Modifications: $1,773 including Firestone Ride-Rites, HD Bilsten shocks, Garmin GPS, new camper house battery, spring-loaded turnbuckles, tie-downs, etc.</li>
<li>Camp and recovery equipment: $1,758 including things like an axe, tools, camp grill, air compressor, Maglite, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Total Set-up: $22,929</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Variable costs</span></p>
<p>These are the must-haves like health insurance, expected vehicle maintenance, visa fees, vehicle shipping, airfare, etc.  These are the easiest to budget as they are either a one time fixed-cost (airfare home) or based on the number of months you’ll be on the road (health insurance).  There always are surprises however.  Our shipping costs from Panama to Colombia sure were a “surprise.”  It would be prudent to include the unexpected here to cover cost over-runs and also unexpected vehicle maintenance such as an engine rebuild or window replacement.</p>
<div id="attachment_2777" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/IMG_4890.jpg" rel="shadowbox[sbpost-2760];player=img;" title="Logan's visit to the Emergency Room"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2777" title="Logan's visit to the Emergency Room" src="http://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/IMG_4890-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Health insurance comes in handy when a metal sliver embeds itself in your cornea</p></div>
<p>Below are our costs for 12 months.  We will update with final numbers once we&#8217;re done and settled.</p>
<ul>
<li>Health insurance: $1,200 for 12 months of coverage with World Nomads</li>
<li>Car insurance: $1,899 for 3rd party only insurance issued by Sanborns</li>
<li>Property/renters insurance: $169 covered theft of belongings</li>
<li>Container shipping to Colombia: $1,973 to share a 40 foot high cube container. This figure includes everything from the boat to the translator to the taxi costs.  You&#8217;ll find this number higher than most others who shipped this year.</li>
<li>Flights to Colombia: $667 &#8211; We regretted not sailing the San Blas islands to Colombia which is cheaper when you account for food and lodging.</li>
<li>Mountain guide in Peru: $800 one week for guide, cook, and food.  Best $800 I&#8217;ve ever spent.</li>
<li>Vehicle and camper repairs: $523 including Firestone Ride-Rite replacement parts and small miscellaneous mechanical work I outsourced.  Does not include maintenance such as oil and filter replacements.</li>
<li>Buenos to US shipping: $1,000 (Expected)</li>
<li>Flights home: $2,000 (Expected)</li>
<li>Oh shit fund: $876 &#8211; The unexpected: Bolivian visa fee, voltage converter, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Total Variable Costs: $ 11,107</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Day-to-day expenses</span></p>
<p>This is the big one; what most people want to know.  Among the couples we’ve met, the range has been anywhere from $30 to $100 per day.  This includes gas, all lodging (campsite fees), food, booze, tours and entertainment.  <strong>We aimed aggressively at $60, but our average expenditures per day have been $72.</strong>  Our figure includes <em>everything</em> not specified in the categories above.<strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p>To give you a sense of the life you get at $72/day: For lunch and dinner we eat out 25-30% of the time, breakfast always in the camper.  We shop at supermarkets 75% of the time and municipal markets (cheaper) 25% of the time.  If we’re in town on the weekends we’ve been known to spent a couple hours in the local cantina.  We bush camp 15% of the time, stay in organized campsites 80% of the time, and only 5% in hotels or hostels.</p>
<div id="attachment_2775" style="width: 388px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/205663_10100210889757067_3619695_52347977_6173432_n.jpg" rel="shadowbox[sbpost-2760];player=img;" title="Afternoon at the cantina"><img class="size-custom0 wp-image-2775" title="Afternoon at the cantina" src="http://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/205663_10100210889757067_3619695_52347977_6173432_n-378x284.jpg" alt="" width="378" height="284" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Surfside brews in Pavones Costa Rica</p></div>
<p>Damn, we live well.  We drink much too much Havana Club and have too many nights on the town to consider ourselves serious budgeters.   Those that spend close to the $30 range, move at a sloth’s pace, rarely pay to camp, and eat out twice a month.  If you plan to do the PanAm (excluding Alaska and Canada) in 8-9 months, start thinking about a trip extension now as your gas costs alone would be more than $30 per day at that pace.</p>
<p>Your pace of travel has a lot to do with day-to-day expenses.  It&#8217;s important to know that our $72 figure was at a 15 month pace (San Francisco to Ushuaia).  We found ourselves moving fast through Mexico on to Costa Rica where we slowed it down.  Aside from gas costs, moving fast means buying more convenience and treating yourself to luxuries after 8 hours of stressful Latin America driving.  If you plan to do the PanAm in 6 months or less, you’re doing something different and this number doesn&#8217;t apply what-so-ever.</p>
<blockquote><p>Living slowly, on or off the road, has a way of making life more affordable.</p></blockquote>
<p>Speaking of gas, this black stuff is 20 &#8211; 25% of our day-to-day expenses.  The ebb and flow (mostly flow) of gas prices can drastically effect your budgeting.  We watched global gas prices <strong>double</strong> from when we started our savings and research (2009) to the time we hit the road in 2011.</p>
<p>$100 a day looks a lot like our life on the road with a few more splurges in the form of organized tours, hotel stays, and steak dinners.</p>
<p>Isn‘t that great?  Your average fly-in vacationer with their organized tour groups and plane ticket expenses can only dream of getting out of the homeland for under $200 per day.</p>

<p>From our 7,500 foot perch, the setting sun has just begun to paint the Boquete Valley a pale pink.  We stand halfway up Panama’s highest point, Volcan Baru, nestled in the Talamarcara range, having driven up 3,000 feet until the rocky trail warns us to go no more.  Before the warm glow of our campfire envelops us, we pass a bottle of Abuelo rum back and forth.  A few carefully placed words break the silence and shift our shared meditation:</p>
<blockquote><p>Can  you believe we have just driven to <strong>Panama</strong> from our home in San Francisco?</p></blockquote>
<p>Two years ago neither my wife nor I had ever heard the word overlanding.  <strong>But after five years of city living and pushing our passions into life’s margins (those rare free weekends)</strong> <strong>we were seeking long term solutions</strong>. In that spirit we made the declaration that we were going to drive to Patagonia in Southern Argentina.  The journey would be our reset button.</p>
<p>Our reset received mixed reviews among friends and family.  The prevailing “advice” was that danger, in the form of a broken truck frame or renegade drug lord, would catch up with us sooner rather than later.  We clung to the positive and after a year and a half of saving and preparation, we cut our ties and pointed our overloaded Tundra south. With the truck and it’s contents our only earthly possessions, we held our breath over each bump and pothole.</p>
<div id="attachment_2258" style="width: 594px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/best3.jpg" rel="shadowbox[sbpost-2250];player=img;" title="Night-scape at Erendira Baja Mexico"><img class="size-large wp-image-2258 " title="Night-scape at Erendira Baja Mexico" src="http://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/best3-1024x660.jpg" alt="" width="584" height="376" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Our First International Camp in Erendira</p></div>
<p>The day we crossed into Tijuana from sunny San Diego we were well aware of our mortality.  The misguided warnings from friends and family hit us like a ton of bricks and we had already begun to second guess our now inescapable plan.  We stood at the gates to Tijuana where the sign above may as well have read ‘<strong>Welcome to the Realm of Hades</strong>.’</p>
<p>Our first stop in Erendira, as luck would have it, would offer a surf break to be shared with only two spear fishermen.  An eerie feeling remained firmly in our consciousness and followed me as I paddled out at Barney’s Cove.  The absence of fellow surfers fueled my negativity.  The lack of group support back home and now here among the waves felt like an ominous prophecy.</p>
<div id="attachment_2269" style="width: 594px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Good-Beach1.jpg" rel="shadowbox[sbpost-2250];player=img;" title="Barney's Cove Surf, Baja Mexico"><img class="size-large wp-image-2269 " title="Barney's Cove Surf, Baja Mexico" src="http://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Good-Beach1-1024x682.jpg" alt="" width="584" height="388" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Suiting Up Solo at Barney&#39;s Cove</p></div>
<p>Around the third set, I realized a secluded surf break at <strong>the first stop of a twenty thousand mile journey is a life milestone, not a lapse of judgment.</strong>  The Baja sunshine snapped us out of our trance.  From here on out, our first generation Toyota Tundra and pop-up camper was like a puppy unleashed.  Despite only being gently modified, the outfit took us over dunes, around beach coves, and allowed us to find the Baja we sought.</p>
<p>Mexico was chock full of camping options from full plug-ins around the town center to more rustic settings along the seashore.  We feared that this infrastructure would end indefinitely once we hit Guatemala.  However, with a bit of creativity and monetary incentive we were able to camp 110 nights out of 130.</p>
<p>The cultural divide came to a head in Guatemala.  Arriving at the Talisman border in Guatemala, hoards of placard flashing Mexicans sprinted onto the road as we neared.  Standing confidently in the middle of the road they flash their credentials while ordering us to stop.  They demand we continue no further <strong>while banging on the sides of the camper as we pass</strong>. Fortunately for us their reputation precedes them and we continue to the actual border crossing.  The deception continues, however, and we are scammed by a uniformed layman before we even put the truck in park.</p>
<div id="attachment_2257" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/IMG_7208_picnik.jpg" rel="shadowbox[sbpost-2250];player=img;" title="Mex 1"><img class="size-full wp-image-2257 " title="Mex 1" src="http://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/IMG_7208_picnik.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="534" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The Road South (Mex 1)</p></div>
<p>We knew it would get worse.  As we moved south through vibrant El Salvador, the fear of El Amatillo started creeping into our consciousness days before the crossing.  <strong>The infamous El Amatillo border crossing into Honduras was purported to us as the most difficult overland border crossing in the world</strong>.  In most reports we read the victims had either spent hundreds of dollars in bribes or days getting through the mess.  Take your pick.</p>
<p>Then our day had finally come.  It was time to face the demon.</p>
<div id="attachment_2270" style="width: 594px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Hell-On-Earth.jpg" rel="shadowbox[sbpost-2250];player=img;" title="El Amatillo, Honduras"><img class="size-large wp-image-2270" title="El Amatillo, Honduras" src="http://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Hell-On-Earth-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="584" height="438" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Hell On Earth</p></div>
<p>Armed with information and a makeshift guide we stumbled out of El Salvador unscathed and then the bemoaned “helpers” spotted our California plates.  We were like two lonely goldfish in a sea of piranhas.  We dodged their fangs narrowly before handing our bundle of original documents, the most guarded possession of any international overlander, to an official clearly in cahoots with the scammers.</p>
<p><strong>We panicked </strong>and chased our documents around the no man’s land between the two countries before they settled in the hands of the real agent.  The agent took us under her wing and walked us through the entire process.  She was our saving grace and we managed to get through Honduras in one day having to pay only a $10 bribe.</p>
<div id="attachment_2264" style="width: 594px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/IMG_79511.jpg" rel="shadowbox[sbpost-2250];player=img;" title="Lago Atitlan Guatemala"><img class="size-large wp-image-2264 " title="Lago Atitlan Guatemala" src="http://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/IMG_79511-1024x682.jpg" alt="" width="584" height="388" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Soaking up the Sun in Guatemala</p></div>
<p>Through our experience in Honduras, like most Central America border crossings, we found the bark is greater than the bite.  The vibrant cultures that lay on the other side of those crossings always had us smiling within hours.  Even if cultural immersion isn’t your cup of tea, even a mild interest in surfing or picturesque beaches will be enough motivation.</p>
<p>Our chosen route took us from beach to beach.  Oftentimes we were the only souls for miles of coast.  Exploring the coast ensured the heat and humidity would be our constant partners.  From Oaxaca south, the overnight heat index low averaged 80 degrees along the coast.  For this reason the width of the continent was our saving grace.  Getting a break from the heat meant gaining altitude and small mountain towns were never far.</p>
<div id="attachment_2277" style="width: 970px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Mt-Chirripo.jpg" rel="shadowbox[sbpost-2250];player=img;" title="Mt. Chirripo"><img class="size-full wp-image-2277" title="Mt.

Chirripo</p></div>
<p>Surf really is king down here for the adventurous, but we sought out some variety.  The highpoint of Costa Rica, non-volcanic Cerro Chirripo at 12,500 feet is the most popular climb and was worth the effort.  During the 6,000’ altitude gain we experienced seemingly every ecosystem of Central America.  Atop the summit both the Pacific and Caribbean Oceans could be seen.</p>
<div id="attachment_2267" style="width: 594px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/IMG_90231.jpg" rel="shadowbox[sbpost-2250];player=img;" title="Santa Catalina, Panama"><img class="size-large wp-image-2267" title="Santa Catalina, Panama" src="http://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/IMG_90231-1024x724.jpg" alt="" width="584" height="412" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Morning Commute in Panama</p></div>
<p>Culturally, our Spanish emersion came to a halt at the Costa Rica border.  Once through most of Central America, the flagrant English and fast food joints came as a shock.  <strong>Convenience in Guatemala and Nicaragua translated to children standing on the dirt road shoulder offering fresh iguana and bags of water. </strong> Throughout Costa Rica and Panama you’re never far from a Dominos pizza.</p>
<p>We set out to spend only $60 a day (gas, lodging, food, etc.) which proved to be entirely possible, but an extra $20 a day afforded us more experiences and comforts. <strong>We did not once overnight at a gas station and drank 7 year Havana Club rum at will.</strong>  Costa Rica was our budget breaker, but long (free) surf sessions and camping kept the costs in check.</p>
<p>Central America was only an appetizer for us as we continue onto South America where we will spend 10 months.  For this purpose it was the perfect pre-requisite.  Our nerves were slightly on edge, we had concerns about safety and the ability of our overland set-up, our Spanish was only so-so, and we often recalled the worries of our friends back home. By the time we reached Panama our worries had narrowed and we had passed Overlanding 101.</p>
<p>Bring on South America.</p>

<p>We crossed from Peru into Bolivia at the Yunguyo border town on a Sunday afternoon. This is a relaxed border mainly used for travel to Copacabana. There is a one hour time change between the two countries. We arrived at the Peruvian immigration office at 1PM (Peru time) and finished six minutes later. The Bolivian entry process was similarly quick, we were in and out in less than thirty minutes.</p>
<div id="attachment_2212" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Peru-Immigration-and-police-exit.jpg" rel="shadowbox[sbpost-2210];player=img;" title="Peruvian Immigration and Police Office"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2212" title="Peruvian Immigration and Police Office" src="http://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Peru-Immigration-and-police-exit-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Peruvian Immigration and Police Office</p></div>
<p>Drive all the way up to the chain barrier on the Peru side, park on the right. Get your tourist cards stamped at the police office (green building) across the street (left). Go next door to give up your tourist cards and obtain your exit stamps in the immigration office (yellow building). Go back across the street (right) to the white aduana building to give up your vehicle permit. We were not asked to produce any originals or copies at this point. You are now checked out of Peru.</p>
<p>Drive under the cement overhang and up to the iron gate, park on the right. Go to immigration for your entry stamps and visa. This step requires the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>$135 cash in US dollars per person (each bill will be inspected rigorously, no rips or tears)</li>
<li>2 color passport photos (2 inches x 2 inches)</li>
<li>Bolivian Visa <a href="http://www.boliviawdc.com/index.php?option=com_smartformer&amp;formid=18" target="_blank">Form</a></li>
<li>Bolivian tourist form obtained at immigration</li>
</ul>
<div id="attachment_2213" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Bolivia-Immigration-entry.jpg" rel="shadowbox[sbpost-2210];player=img;" title="Bolivia Immigration and Money Exchange"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2213" title="Bolivia Immigration and Money Exchange" src="http://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Bolivia-Immigration-entry-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Bolivia Immigration and Money Exchange</p></div>
<p>It is possible to show up at the border with just $135 US cash. You can complete all the necessary paperwork on the spot. Completing the visa form in advance online saves you some time. If you don&#8217;t have a picture for your visa they appear to have a large stash of leftover photos and will try to match you up as best they can with a stranger.</p>
<p>The above was all we needed, but the following additional items may be required depending on the border official&#8217;s mood:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hotel reservation</li>
<li>Country itinerary (both can be created in your email)</li>
<li>Yellow Fever vaccination card</li>
<li>Bank statement or copy of credit card proving economic solvency</li>
</ul>
<p>We did not have exact change for our visa fee which we heard was necessary but the officials provided change to us. Results may vary. We found that anticipating every step really speeds the process along and eliminates areas where a border official may require a bribe. We received a 90 day visa with no problems.</p>
<p>The white aduana building is up the hill to the left of the immigration office. In order to import your vehicle into Bolivia you will need to show your original title, a copy of your title, and a copy of your passport. We received 90 days on the import permit without issue. Our official stamped the form, opened the gate, and we were officially in Bolivia.</p>
<div id="attachment_2214" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Bolivia-Aduana-entry.jpg" rel="shadowbox[sbpost-2210];player=img;" title="Bolivia Aduana "><img class="size-medium wp-image-2214" title="Bolivia Aduana " src="http://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Bolivia-Aduana-entry-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Bolivia Aduana</p></div>
<p>Most people we&#8217;ve spoken with have had to find a police officer to provide a second stamp on the import permit and to open the gate. No such instruction was given to us!</p>
<p>At no point were we asked to pay anything other than the $135 visa fee. Nearly all of our border crossings have been on a Sunday afternoon. We feel this has played a role in our good luck with borders. On Fridays, border agents are thinking about funding their imminent bar tab. While on Sundays, they&#8217;re fresh from repentance in church.</p>
<p>Copacabana is a quick eight km drive from the border where you can dine on trout and camp on the beach for free. We&#8217;ve heard there is one ATM in town but we never found it. The exchange rate on the Bolivian side is much better than on the Peruvian side.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>EXCHANGE RATE (as of 9/24/11):</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">$1 US = 6.96 Bolivianos</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">1 Peruvian Sole = 2.51 Bolivianos</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">This information is free and we encourage recirculation, we only ask for a shout-out to PanAmNotes.com.<br />
Please email with any questions or corrections: &#117;&#115;&#064;&#097;&#103;&#114;&#111;&#111;&#116;&#115;&#046;&#099;&#111;&#109;.</p>

<p>So, we navigated Mexico and Central America using <strong>the latest 16th century technology</strong>. It proved to be a valuable experience in patience, culture, and geography. We quickly learned Castallano for <em>turn left at the tree</em> and <em>keep straight ahead until you pass a shack</em>. More importantly we learned that Latinos will <strong>gladly and confidently</strong> provide directions regardless of their knowledge of the route.</p>

<p>We circled many colonial streets in confusion, cursing every municipality from Mexico to Honduras; the camper groaning with the weight of our misdirection. Eight countries later, in Panama, we had our paper system of navigation zeroed in. <strong>And then there was Vince.</strong></p>
<p>Like a ray of sunshine bursting through a cloudy sky, a San Diego native on a <strong>KTM Adventure</strong> showed us the light. He was returning from a two year sojourn and presented us with <a href="http://www.drivetheamericas.com/forums/gps-map-answers" target="_blank">free routable maps</a> for every country we would be passing through.</p>
<div id="attachment_2063" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/IMG_9121.jpg" rel="shadowbox[sbpost-2061];player=img;" title="Can we get much higher?"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2063" title="Can we get much higher?" src="http://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/IMG_9121-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">High as a kite en route to Arequipa Peru</p></div>
<p>Now using the latest 21st century technology, including Garmin MapSource, we can route the entire continent with waypoints of prime camping spots, grocery stores, and gas stations. While still in Peru we can have all of Bolivia routed and plotted. Turn-by-turn directions through large cities like Lima are <strong>the security blanket you need when every lane of traffic is attacking you with a vengeance.</strong></p>

<p>If you’re worried about losing some sense of adventure with your GPS, fear not. <strong>Latin America always has the last laugh.</strong> Landslides, changing political tones, and even emerging and declining economies ensure that roads are constantly transforming. That rotted out, single track, suspension breaking, switchback will find you regardless of your technology.</p>
