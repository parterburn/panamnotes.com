<p>Despite the remarkably relaxed atmosphere in town, we learned fuel service had been suspended for the past three days. This was hard to believe, <strong>no one seemed bothered</strong>. The military presence on every other corner seemed like overkill. Soldiers in riot gear had no one to preside over except kids flying by on bicycles and tourists browsing local crafts. So we followed suit, wasting away the weekend chatting with a local fly-fishing guide.</p>
<div id="attachment_3322" style="width: 435px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/IMG_7531.jpg" rel="shadowbox[sbpost-3319];player=img;" title="Planning under the influence"><img class="size-custom0 wp-image-3322" title="Planning under the influence" src="https://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/IMG_7531-425x284.jpg" alt="" width="425" height="284" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Stocked up on Bloody Mary supplies and got down to business</p></div>
<p>At sun up on Monday the town awoke and started lining up at the Copec gas station. We arrived late to find the line was already occupying 16 city blocks, nearly two miles long. <strong>There was no gas, no promise of gas arriving, just a rumor that a tanker might arrive after sundown.</strong></p>
<p>We pulled in line and waited. For 13 hours we sat, advancing whenever somebody ahead of us gave up hope. Sundown came and saw only the arrival of a peaceful protest. The Aysen region is fed up and has been for many years now. <a href="http://www.santiagotimes.cl/chile/politics/chile/politics/23428-chile-orders-special-cabinet-meeting-to-defuse-aysen-uprising" target="_blank">Here</a> are their demands.</p>

<p>After sundown our fellow waiters began to abandon their cars, saving their place for the night. We gave in, popped up, and settled in for some urban camping. But at 10:30 people were sprinting toward their vehicles, every car on the block firing up their engines, and joyous shouts of “petrol, petrol!” filled the streets.</p>
<p>At this point there are nearly a thousand vehicles in the line, hundreds both ahead and behind us. Polite line etiquette is a thing of the past, every man for himself. Bleary eyed and pajama clad we scramble to the truck, forgetting the surfboard and whacking the still popped up camper into an overhead grocery store sign.</p>
<p>We don’t know why but suddenly people are freaking out. Flairs are going up and chaos is taking hold. <strong>Along with the sun, the peace has vanished and things are turning ugly.</strong> People running from the scene stop to warn us: <em>¡Tiene que salir! </em>(you have to leave). We didn’t know it at the time but they had taken down an electrical transistor and set it ablaze with anything they could get their hands on.</p>
<div id="attachment_3332" style="width: 435px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/IMG_7630.jpg" rel="shadowbox[sbpost-3319];player=img;" title="Blockage"><img class="size-custom0 wp-image-3332 " title="Blockage" src="https://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/IMG_7630-425x284.jpg" alt="" width="425" height="284" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Far from our spot in line, this was the scene at the edge of town</p></div>
<p>They had successfully intercepted the fuel truck with a flaming road block. To celebrate the achievement they were headed back to town, coming directly at us, throwing bricks and rocks at anything and everything. We got the hell out of there, warning other overlanders on our way out (a French family asleep in their RV!).</p>
<p>Early the next morning, the long line had vanished. Pulling up nearer the gas station we realized they had gas! An hour later we had our rationed 6 gallons&#8230; Combined with our 5 gallon jerry can we could make Rio Mayo in Argentina.</p>
<div id="attachment_3328" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/IMG_7598.jpg" rel="shadowbox[sbpost-3319];player=img;" title="&quot;And I'm like YES!&quot;"><img class="size-medium wp-image-3328" title="&quot;And I'm like YES!&quot;" src="https://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/IMG_7598-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Not quite awake, but happy to be in a moving line</p></div>

<p>We headed out of town via a little-used dirt road squeezing around still smoldering piles of rubbish (and nails!) before arriving at one well-manned roadblock.<strong> For one hour each day they allow passenger cars to cross.</strong> We buzzed by at the tail-end of this window. Three hours and a border crossing later we pulled into Rio Mayo Argentina on fumes learning they too were out of gas.</p>
<div id="attachment_3334" style="width: 435px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/IMG_7636.jpg" rel="shadowbox[sbpost-3319];player=img;" title="End of Pavement"><img class="size-custom0 wp-image-3334" title="End of Pavement" src="https://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/IMG_7636-425x266.jpg" alt="" width="425" height="266" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">That&#39;s about right</p></div>
<p>**Luck was on our side, it seems we saw the last fuel tanker for a while. Our friends over at Bodeswell are still <a href="http://bodeswell.org/2012/03/03/the-new-field-operatives/" target="_blank">waiting</a>**</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Now on the Pacific slope the first thing we notice is that everything is a brilliant green.  Coming from the Argentine side, where endless golden plains stretch out in all directions, the scenery here is all the more captivating. In Chilean Patagonia luscious foliage hangs over the roads and infiltrates every square inch of unattended land.</p>
<div id="attachment_3297" style="width: 435px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/IMG_7503.jpg" rel="shadowbox[sbpost-3288];player=img;" title="Peacfeul"><img class="size-custom0 wp-image-3297" title="Peacfeul" src="https://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/IMG_7503-425x257.jpg" alt="" width="425" height="257" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Verde</p></div>
<p>The Carretera Austral connects far-flung rural communities through 1200km of mostly rough, unpaved road. The year 2000 saw the completion of the last 100km, 34 years after construction began. The logic behind Pinochet’s masterpiece drew much criticism due to the impossibly remote terrain, but <strong>this bumpy stretch of highway maintains a permanent place in overland folklore.</strong></p>
<p>Our first day on the fabled road had us circling Lake General Carrera, knowing we were driving on borrowed time. With only one month left in The Beast our daily conversations are increasingly weighty; the road-less future ahead and what it will mean to sit still for a while. Our minds often drift from the present, contemplating Nebraska, Antarctica, and everywhere in between.</p>
<div id="attachment_3293" style="width: 459px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/IMG_7433.jpg" rel="shadowbox[sbpost-3288];player=img;" title="Day One"><img class="size-small-feature wp-image-3293" title="Day One" src="https://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/IMG_7433-449x300.jpg" alt="" width="449" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">What lies ahead</p></div>
<p>Yet after fifteen countries, over fifteen months, <strong>the road still provides for us</strong>. She pulls us out of our silent reveries with a perfectly placed bend in the road, a hidden cathedral of peaks on the horizon, a lake as blue as the sky and smooth as glass.  We could never tire of this life.</p>
<div id="attachment_3291" style="width: 459px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/IMG_7416.jpg" rel="shadowbox[sbpost-3288];player=img;" title="Lake General Carrera"><img class="size-small-feature wp-image-3291" title="Lake General Carrera" src="https://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/IMG_7416-449x300.jpg" alt="" width="449" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Lakeview</p></div>

<div id="attachment_3295" style="width: 501px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/IMG_7465.jpg" rel="shadowbox[sbpost-3288];player=img;" title="Highway livin"><img class="size-small-feature wp-image-3295" title="Highway livin" src="https://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/IMG_7465-491x300.jpg" alt="" width="491" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The roads that force you to take it slow are the most memorable</p></div>
<div id="attachment_3296" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/IMG_7490.jpg" rel="shadowbox[sbpost-3288];player=img;" title="Growl"><img class="size-full wp-image-3296" title="Growl" src="https://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/IMG_7490.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="608" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">You can practically hear the Beast growl</p></div>
<p>Right now Argentina has a monopoly on Patagonia and the overpriced souvenir trinkets to prove it.  They bet big on the region early on, posting road-signs stating <strong>“To know Patagonia is a duty.”</strong>  But, driving through Chile’s secluded single road version we feel the future of Patagonia is here.  Uninhabited islands, unclimbed peaks, and no easy way to get there.</p>
<p>Chile doesn’t seem to know what it has here.  We are left wondering if we will be some of the last people to see these valleys undamned.  The idea is a noble one: to wean itself off expensive foreign energy.  But it is Chile’s pristine landscapes that will be paying the price by erecting enormous environment-altering hydroelectric plants in these valleys.</p>

Over a few beers and a fine dinner we grilled him on his experience working in Antarctica for the season. <strong>Our interest was piqued</strong> but we had to get along before Malin would return from the ice.</p>

<p>We made a beeline for the country’s southern crown jewel, Parque Nacional Torres del Paine. Considered one of the continent’s finest national parks and this the prime season to visit, we were prepared for the crowds after a couple weeks on the deserted back roads of Tierra del Fuego.</p>
<p>The area is famous for unpredictable weather; <strong>they have four seasons here like everywhere else but they tend to hit you all in the same day</strong>. On a day hike to Glacier Grey, we encountered summer sunshine, a ferocious five minute rainstorm, and intense winds nearly capable of knocking us over.</p>

<p>Later that night we camped out among our finest surroundings yet at Lago Pehoe. For just a minute at dusk the winds died down, the clouds cleared and it was us and a campfire overlooking the twisted Torres del Paine mountain range.</p>

<p>The next day we set out to tackle a part of the ‘W’ trek and experience the Torres up close. Dark clouds, a constant drizzle, and fierce winds accompanied us on our march toward camp. The trail wound up a desolate rocky mountainside and eventually gave way to forested wilderness. At camp the winds kept us tucked away in the tent where we roasted marshmallows and turned in early in anticipation of our morning hike to view the towers.</p>

<p><strong>We estimated to have shared the six mile path with 200 others later that day</strong> but our morning at the viewpoint was totally deserted. A rare moment of tranquil solitude was fitting as we stood in the shadow of the enormous granite spires. Our time of quiet contemplation was shattered on our way down when an impatient hiker shoved his way through a large group of elderly tourists. “<em>Tranquilo!</em>” their guide shouted after him to no effect.</p>
<p>This park is unique, via trail it is the equivalent of a New Jersey theme park but on the road the crowds disperse and a sense of isolation takes hold. Alone with the herds of guanacos, we sought secret territory and solitude.</p>

<p>In the forgotten northeast corner of the park we spent a few days camping and hiking near Laguna Azul. A handful of backpackers trekked through the area quietly in the afternoons. Horses roamed free searching out the best grazing areas. A period of usual calm caused us to linger, soaking in the undisturbed beauty of our surroundings. <strong>Edging north and moving closer to home each day, stops like this truly sweeten our final days on the PanAm.</strong></p>

<p>Our plan from here is to explore western Patagonia, making our way home over the next two months. The immediate future holds backpacking Torres del Paine, traversing up Chile’s Carretera Austral, hiking around Fitz Roy, watching over the Moreno Glacier, and trout fishing the Lake District. <strong>Overlanding Patagonia, our victory lap, in itself is a journey of a lifetime.</strong></p>
<div id="attachment_3152" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/map-pat.jpg" rel="shadowbox[sbpost-3145];player=img;" title="Patagonia Map"><img class="size-small-feature wp-image-3152" title="Patagonia Map" src="https://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/map-pat-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">A map of the southern cone</p></div>
<p>The idea from the beginning was to return to the US and land new lucrative careers in the mountain state of our choosing. The picture is still vivid but a 10% jobless rate and economic outlook act as our grey cloud. None-the-less, <strong>the real world start-date marches closer.</strong> Thankfully two years ago, almost as an afterthought, we earmarked a portion of our savings as a ‘life relocation fund.’</p>
<p>Our first few months back stateside we plan on embarking on a US-wide tour. We’re coming to a neighborhood near your. Well everywhere except Loveland, where Logan’s sister-in-law has repeatedly stated that she will call the cops if she sees a camper in her neighborhood.</p>
<div id="attachment_3150" style="width: 435px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/IMG_6903.jpg" rel="shadowbox[sbpost-3145];player=img;" title="Ferry ride"><img class="size-custom0 wp-image-3150" title="Ferry ride" src="https://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/IMG_6903-425x284.jpg" alt="" width="425" height="284" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Leaving Tierra del Fuego via ferry</p></div>
<p>The more distant future is full of unknowns. We’ve made a plan A (overland Africa in four years), plan B (through-hike the Appalachian Trail in two), plan C (gainfully employed for life), all the way through Z (Antarctica next season). About the only thing we know now is that we will be returning to the US, probably somewhere in the middle, for as long as she’ll keep us.</p>
<p>We’re at an end and need to recharge the mind and wallet. <strong>The Beast is not.</strong> <a href="http://carlandheathergosouth.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">Carl and Heather</a> of Seattle are taking her on another lap around the world. The Beast was born to roam free.</p>
<p>So it is the Patagonian frontier where we will ride out the autumn of our trip. From there our desires are simple: family, friends, and living in the known world in a home without wheels. At least for a little while.</p>
