				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Our last day, like the last month was spent running around accumulating equipment in apparent preparation for the apocalypse.  One step forward and one step back, but it don&#8217;t pay to live like that. Man made absolutes have no place in a well lived life.The truth is, you are never fully ready.  The perfect time is never.  Nonetheless, we strike off into a Wilder West tomorrow.</p>
<p>In the last several weeks we said goodbye to many great friends down the California coast, stopping in Santa Barbara, Los Angeles, and San Diego.  Yesterday Logan remarked &#8220;I&#8217;m glad we didn&#8217;t make it south much over the last several years otherwise we&#8217;d have set up camp here and never left.&#8221; This pair of raggedy road trippers could not have asked for better hospitality and generosity.</p>
<p>Although even the smallest decisions now seem to carry the weight and importance of an annual pay raise meeting, Baja beckons. Nothing can stop us now.  Tomorrow we will camp outside of Ejido Erendira a town of &#8220;about 1,100,&#8221; nobody&#8217;s sure.  There we will spend unmeasurable time under the Baja sun realigning and adjusting to a new chapter.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s to one more night of whiskey shots under a neon moon in a dark and windowless dive, the American way.</p>
<p>God Bless.</p>
