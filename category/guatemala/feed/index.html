After finding a spot for our rig among the dozen others in the yard, we were approached by a group of Germans. The next day at 0500 they planned to leave camp to summit Volcan Acatenango (13,045’) and were eager for us to join them, we quickly said yes.</p>
<p>After the usual preparations, 0415 arrived rapidly. 13 of us packed into two trucks and  headed up the winding dirt road toward the looming volcano in the Western horizon, windows down, mariachi blaring. Included in our large group were two police officers, hired to guide us on our volcanic journey.</p>
<p>We stopped at what appeared to be a 19th century farm which turned out to be our trail-head. We passed fields where farmers were planting hillside plots by hand and hauling their crops via the same trail we  would use to ascend. I contemplated the US food structure, flawed as it may be, the system gave rise to the very leisure class that now bemoans it.  Self destructive, but maybe rightfully so.</p>
<p>These are things you use to distract your mind as you walk begrudgingly up a volcano. Latin America does not believe in switchbacks and you must keep your mind off the 35 pounds on your back and the 4,000 feet of uphill ahead.</p>
<div id="attachment_768" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Volcan-001.jpg" rel="shadowbox[sbpost-767];player=img;" title="Overlooking Volcan Toliman"><img class="size-medium wp-image-768" title="Overlooking Volcan Toliman" src="http://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Volcan-001-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">We saw this volcano across the lake during our stay in Pana</p></div>
<p>When we stop, we exchange words as a group in a mix of Spanish, German, and English. As we continue we quickly learn Western Europeans and Americans have different philosophies in climbing mountains. We pass through several campsites between 10K and 11K feet that will no doubt be occupied by Americans that very evening.  We pass these spots en route to our campsite, a mere 500 feet below the summit. We arrive there at noon, in order to attain the summit twice before departure the next day. We planned to summit once in the late afternoon and then a second time early the next morning before sunrise. I now more thoroughly understand the lack of American presence among the world-class mountaineers (with apologies to Mark Twight).</p>
<div id="attachment_769" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Volcan-002.jpg" rel="shadowbox[sbpost-767];player=img;" title="Campsite above the clouds"><img class="size-medium wp-image-769" title="Campsite above the clouds" src="http://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Volcan-002-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">at 12,500&#39; this is the highest we&#39;ve ever camped</p></div>
<p>Without agreeing to in any way other than a mutual exhaustion we all fell into our tents for an afternoon siesta. We nursed headaches and swollen feet in our campsite above the clouds and skipped summit attempt one of two. That night we celebrated around a campfire and hit the sack before 8PM in anticipation of a 0330 wake up call.</p>
<div id="attachment_770" style="width: 235px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Volcan-003.jpg" rel="shadowbox[sbpost-767];player=img;" title="Volcan Agua"><img class="size-medium wp-image-770 " title="Volcan Agua" src="http://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Volcan-003-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Volcan Agua peaking through the clouds</p></div>
<p>When the alarm sounds, the early hour feels all too soon, despite the 7.5 hours of restful sleep. We find the site filled with frozen water bottles and eager Germans. Moving quickly through the darkness we began  hiking the last 500 feet of volcano. Before you know it we’re on the crater rim and hear what sounds like a not-so-distant avalanche. A quick rundown of SAM logic reveals there is not a drop of snow on this mountain and the rumbling emanates from nearby Volcan Fuego, the moonlight reveals her plume.</p>
<p>We circled the rim atop the cloud cover for another hour, switching our sights from the erupting volcano to  the slowly approaching sunrise in the eastern sky. You can easily spot both from one vantage, but the biting cold encourages us to stay on the move. We desperately attempt to capture the scene with photographs and words. When the sun finally appears, the cameras are packed away and words have escaped our grasp. We are left with only a hushed silence as we contemplate our own existence on the solitary walk downhill.</p>
<div id="attachment_772" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Volcan-005.jpg" rel="shadowbox[sbpost-767];player=img;" title="Volcan Agua"><img class="size-medium wp-image-772" title="Volcan Agua" src="http://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Volcan-005-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Stopping to take it all in on the decent</p></div>
<p>After basking in the morning sun at camp, we pack it up and begin an uneventful trek down to the trail-head; our movements more resemble falling than hiking in the soft, silt dirt. Three hours later, we find a single pickup to haul all 13 of us back to yet another camp.</p>
<p>Afterward, like all mountaineering adventures, somehow two days of sweat and dirt transform into something much larger than the sum of its parts. You forget the pain and turn your attention to the next mountain.</p>

What appeared to a be a quick route from border crossing to campsite quickly turned into an uphill battle between us and the road as we gained 5,000 feet. Although the winding highways were in fairly good shape, navigating through large city centers was an extravagant waste of daylight. If there is a street sign, it is often painted onto the side of a building and most have faded away completely.

Further, the highways of Latin America were built to pass through the colonial cobblestone streets of each town center. Imagine I-80 routed through the one-way alleys of Chinatown.</p>
<p>Finally arriving at camp, we set up under moonlight on the shore of Lago de Atitlan next to Hotel Vision Azul and awoke to a magnificent sunrise.  The cool mountain air at 5,200’ was a welcome reprise from the humid Pacific coast. Our days were spent at camp mapping out the future and by night we explored the city streets. After a month in Mexico where we were constantly confronted with fearsome travel warnings, we were surprised to find international visitors pouring into the city at all hours. Pana is an international hotspot rivaled only by Antigua, our next stop.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As we prepare for a border crossing we often consult our maps and do a read through (or three) of the several guidebooks we keep on hand. Lonely Planet always outlines border crossing via airline first. This never fails to amuse us and we find ourselves reminiscing over our own international flight experiences. You arrive in the waiting area, gazing sleepily at the tarmac, awaiting a dramamine induced slumber on your way to paradise. A couple of hours and a bag of peanuts later, you have filled out your international visitor&#8217;s form and are dumped into an air conditioned waiting room with hundreds of other gringos. The rest is a carefully laid out, practically fail proof system, to get you where you need to go. Grab luggage, find hotel shuttle, tip bell boy, find pool, drink cocktail, vacation attained.</p>
<p>A far cry from an air conditioned airport terminal was the Guatemala (Talisman) border crossing.  The half mile leading to the border is inundated with very aggressive Mexican &#8220;helpers&#8221; yelling, banging on your car, and even standing directly in front of your vehicle. They spend their day &#8220;helping&#8221; gringos across the border, but often take advantage by increasing the prices of the various fees you must pay. Finding the real border crossing is a journey in and of itself. We made the border and were given our first task: backtrack 30 miles to give up our Mexican vehicle permit. With our one-track minds directing us to the border we bypassed the vehicle checkpoint (not in the guidebook).</p>
<p>An hour later we were headed for the border again, once more fighting off the helpers. We successfully passed through the border gates but missed the parking lot for the customs office. Already a bit on edge, an official looking gentlemen in uniform stopped us and requested $10Q. Racking our brains to figure out the best way to politely ask why, a large group of helpers formed behind the official and began yelling all sorts of unintelligible nonsense. Ultimately we decided: this guy has a uniform, a name badge, and he&#8217;s offering us a receipt, pay the man. We were scammed before putting our truck into park. </p>
<p>We parked in front of the Guatemala migration office and hiked back to the Mexican customs office. There is a special kind of urgency in the power walk that ensues when you leave your truck out of sight in a strange land. With passports freshly stamped and a midday sweat threatening to completely take over our freshly laundered clothes, we returned to the migration office. We paid a helper to keep an eye on the truck, which persuaded the bystanders to only steal one pair of hiking shoes, as we went in search of our Guatemalan vehicle permit. When we popped the top for inspection, there was a unanimous intonation of understanding among our growing audience of helpers and locals. The official smiled and said &#8220;Oh, es su casa!&#8221; With that, we left our house in the hands of our trusted helper again, to pay a few more fees before we could return for fumigation. </p>
<p>Finally our tires have been sprayed, the permits obtained, the fees (and scams) have been paid. Cocktails? Dip in the pool? Quick siesta before dinner? No. What&#8217;s next is a winding sign-less road, an unfolded map, and a destination we hope to reach before sunset. What&#8217;s next is four large, archaic cities where we anticipate getting lost among cobblestone streets which cause the camper to squeak and sigh with the weight of our misdirection. There is no HBO on demand awaiting us on the other side, there is no gringo fluent waitress ready to serve up a much desired mojito, there probably is not even a shower. While our pictures have given a particularly charming view of the scenery, this is only part of the story.</p>
<p>During our expedition there will be tears, there will be yelling, and there will be moments when our minds quiver with the onslaught of new <del datetime="2011-02-23T23:04:13+00:00">information</del> inspiration. This journey is all exclusive.</p>
