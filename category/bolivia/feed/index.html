				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Uyuni (pronounced oo-you-nee)</strong></p>
<p>It’s best to think of Uyuni as an outpost, not a destination or town.  Get in, get stocked up, and hit the dirt road outta there.  It is a good place to meet other overlanders and Minutemen Pizza is a great place to waste away an evening.  For an outpost of a place it has a bit of charm.</p>

<p><em>Getting Gas</em></p>
<p>There are three gas stations in town.  When you first enter town you’ll see a YPFB station.  They would not sell us gas, but know that if you beg them they will fill you up at the international price of B/8.40 a liter.  You can fill up with non-potable water here.  The gas station north of town wouldn’t fill us either.</p>
<p>We were able to fill up at the local’s price, B/3.75/L, at the Servicentro G.C. (S20 28.185 W66 49.204) on the southwest edge of town.  Tell them you don’t need a receipt and will pay a tip (No nesicitamos una factura y pagamos una propina).  The attendant wasn’t even expecting a tip, just willing to give us the local’s price.  They are closed for lunch and on Sundays.</p>
<p>It is tough to say how the tourist gasoline pricing is going to play out in the future.  We filled up six times and never had any trouble getting the local price (before Uyuni).  We met some folks in a Land Rover 110 covered with sponsor stickers and they had trouble at every single fill-up in the country.  In the following years getting the local price may be more of a challenge or the price discrimination may drop all together if/when Evo leaves office.</p>
<div id="attachment_2590" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/IMG_0329.jpg" rel="shadowbox[sbpost-2578];player=img;" title="Land Cruisers in the distance"><img class="size-full wp-image-2590" title="Land Cruisers in the distance" src="https://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/IMG_0329.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Bolivian Altiplano</p></div>
<p><em>Getting Propane</em></p>
<p>Behind the YPFB station is a YPFB GLP plant (S20 27.365 W66 48.855).  They were able to fill our US style propane bottle without issue for only B/10.  They close from 12-3 for lunch.  With a full propane bottle we were able to run the heater at will.  Finding this place was a stroke of luck and made our time in the region much more enjoyable.</p>
<p><em>Car Wash and Fumigation</em></p>
<p>Prior to going on the Salar we had our vehicle washed and fumigated at the following place directly across from the gas station: S20 28.156 W66 49.172.  They recommend spraying used oil on the underside of your vehicle (they call this fumigation).  When you return they spray the salt, dirt, and oil all off.  It is a great wash for only B/30 (exterior only).</p>
<p><em>Camping in Town</em></p>
<p>Many overlanders camp near Minutemen Pizza or the main square.  There is a military base on the main street of town.  The town has public bathrooms near the square and showers can be purchased at this lavanderia: S20 27.831 W66 49.412</p>
<p>We camped in Hostel Marith’s parking lot (S20 27.941 W66 49.602) for B/25 per person.  It was not much to look at but had electricity (for an extra B/10, plug in at the workshop) and nice hot showers.</p>
<p><em>Other Uyuni Info</em></p>
<p>There is no grocery store and we found the municipal market to be mediocre at best.  The meat we bought there was inedible.  I’m not sure why this surprised us; as far as the eye can see, the land is barren.  There are a handful ATMs in town.  Broadband internet is available at an internet café along the square.  Minutemen Pizza (excellent pizza) wifi is for hotel guests only and we found no other place with wifi.</p>
<div id="attachment_2624" style="width: 1010px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/cropped-IMG_0067.jpg" rel="shadowbox[sbpost-2578];player=img;" title="The Salar de Uyuni"><img class="size-full wp-image-2624" title="The Salar de Uyuni" src="https://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/cropped-IMG_0067.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="288" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Eerie horizon</p></div>
<p><strong>The Salar de Uyuni</strong></p>
<p><em>Access</em></p>
<p>The closest salar access point is 25km north of Uyuni, S20 18.972 W66 58.889.  Those 25km are some of the worst corrugations we’ve seen in Latin America.  There are dirt roads on the side you can take alternatively.  When driving onto the salar it is important to stay on the track (which is black from all the tires).  Here it is possible to break through the surface and get stuck.  If in doubt, stop and wait for a land cruiser or a salt truck and follow them.  Once you are on the surface you’re free to roam off the tracks.  4&#215;4 isn’t usually needed, we have friends that drove the salar in a minivan.</p>
<p><em>Salar Camping and Features</em></p>
<p>It is suitable to camp anywhere on the salar.  The sunsets are spectacular.  Island Incahuasi (S20 14.458 W67 37.657) is an interesting site with hiking trails and many cacti.  A B/30 entrance fee gives you access to the island which has services such as bathrooms, a water faucet, restaurant, and trash cans.</p>
<p>South of Island Incahuasi are a few other islands with no fees.  At the southern end is the Gruta de las Galaxies two different caves discovered recently with interesting formations.</p>
<div id="attachment_2637" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/IMG_0043.jpg" rel="shadowbox[sbpost-2578];player=img;" title="Isla Icahuasi"><img class="size-full wp-image-2637" title="Isla Icahuasi" src="https://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/IMG_0043.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Looking at the road to Chile</p></div>
<p><em>Salar Weather</em></p>
<p>On the salar in October we experienced warm sunny days.  It’s important to take sunscreen and wear sunglasses.  Because of the white surface your eyes can get painfully sun burnt.  Each afternoon the wind picked up from the west and blew hard until after sunset.  Each night it dipped below freezing.</p>
<div id="attachment_2592" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/IMG_0403.jpg" rel="shadowbox[sbpost-2578];player=img;" title="The Lagunas Route"><img class="size-full wp-image-2592" title="The Lagunas Route" src="https://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/IMG_0403.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Painted mountains</p></div>
<p><strong>The Lagunas Route (Routa de las Lagunas)</strong></p>
<p><em>Mileage and Gas</em></p>
<p>We broke up the trip into two portions due to our gas range.  After the salar we returned to Uyuni for a car wash and to refuel.  We are glad we did.  We had averaged 14-16 MPG on the roads of Peru and Bolivia.  While on the Lagunas Route, we averaged 12 MPG, a 20% decrease.  This figure is aided by the last 49km to San Pedro in which you lose 6,500 feet (2,000m) in elevation.</p>
<p>Our total mileage from Uyuni to San Pedro de Atacama: 295 miles (475 km).  This does include a few extraneous side trips but I estimate those accounted for less than 12 miles (20 km).</p>
<p>I estimate that you would need to add another 70 miles (110 km) if planning to visit the salar, Island Incahuasi, and then head south straight to the Lagunas route for a total of 365 miles (585 km).  This is just an estimate. UNurban didn&#8217;t refuel in Uyuni and their  mileage was closer to 700km.</p>
<p>If leaving from Uyuni there is a gas station on the way to the lagunas route in San Cristobel, S21 09.242 W67 10.006.  This is only 54 miles (87 kms) south of Uyuni.  Additionally they are occasionally out of gas and/or diesel.</p>
<div id="attachment_2591" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/IMG_0362-1.jpg" rel="shadowbox[sbpost-2578];player=img;" title="Rocky Canyon"><img class="size-full wp-image-2591" title="Rocky Canyon" src="https://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/IMG_0362-1.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="615" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The route turns rocky</p></div>
<p><em>Road conditions</em></p>
<p>Leaving Uyuni, the first 100 miles (160 kms) the road is in good condition (Bolivia standards).  We were able to average 60km/h.  From there the road will turn to a rocky two-track road, with multiple options as there are multiple tracks.  It will stay in this condition as you pass Laguna Chulluncani, Hedionda, Chiar Kkota, and Honda.</p>
<p>There was one deep river crossing, just over two feet deep and about 20 feet across.  In a couple of spots you will navigate up through a rocky canyon.  I needed 4&#215;4 low to get through.  This northern part of the lagunas route was some of the finest off-road navigating we found in all of Latin America.  Do not miss it.</p>
<p>By the time you enter the park boundaries around the Arbol de Piedre (rock tree, S22 03.108 W67 53.076) the road turns to a horrible corrugated mess.  Driving with a truck camper on this type of road is not fun.  The majority of the roads from here to the Highway 27 in Chile were like this.  4&#215;4 was not needed as we saw even a Westfalla (non-synco) on this section of the route.</p>
<div id="attachment_2600" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/IMG_0589.jpg" rel="shadowbox[sbpost-2578];player=img;" title="Laguna Verde"><img class="size-full wp-image-2600" title="Laguna Verde" src="https://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/IMG_0589.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Laguna Verde</p></div>
<p><em>Campsites and Features</em></p>
<p>Campsites and Features are listed in order going from Uyuni to San Pedro de Atamaca</p>
<p>Altiplano Camps near a stream, S21 16.847 W67 16.977 (approximate): Past San Cristobel you will be on the sparsely-populated altiplano.  You can camp anywhere in this area, but there is little to no cover from the road.</p>
<p>Boulder Strewn Area for Camping, S21 24.306 W67 45.770 (approximate):  Much better place to camp as there are numerous large boulders to block the wind and view from the road.  Several great places to turn off and camp several miles before and after the given coordinates.</p>
<p>Laguna Chulluncani Camp, S21 32.414 W67 52.609 4462m: The first flamingo lake you will come across.  No facilities, just flamingos and snow capped peaks.</p>
<p>Los Flamingos, bathrooms and restaurant, S21 34.501 W68 02.449 4137m: B/5 for use of bathroom</p>
<p>Laguna Hedionda Camp, S21 35.023 W68 03.116 4157m: overlooking the lake on a turnoff, great spot</p>
<p>Excellent camping all around Lagunas Chulluncani, Hedionda, Chiar Kkota, and Honda.  After these lakes you will pass through a beautiful altiplano with 360 degree views of snow capped mountains.  Camping here also great but a little higher in elevation compared to the lakes.</p>
<p>Arbol de Piedre feature and bathrooms, S22 03.108 W67 53.076 4580m:  After the ranger/guard begged us for money he charged us B/10 for use of the bathrooms.</p>
<p>Ticket Control, Bathrooms, and a Trash Can, S22 10.255 W67 49.048: Fork over B/150 for a 4 day pass to the Reserva Nacional de Fauna Andina Eduardo Avaora.  It may be best to camp on the north end of Laguna Colorada before entering the gate control to buy yourself more time in the park.</p>
<p>Laguna Colorada Camp, S22 12.767 W67 47.948 4317m: Campsite overlooking the red lagoon.  Nice spot but an even better spot may be before the registration and check point: S22 09.885 W67 47.915.  Camping here buys you an extra day in the park.</p>
<div id="attachment_2595" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/IMG_0501.jpg" rel="shadowbox[sbpost-2578];player=img;" title="Bolivian Aduana"><img class="size-full wp-image-2595" title="Bolivian Aduana" src="https://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/IMG_0501.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="686" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Bolivian Aduana</p></div>
<p>ADUANA, S22 26.454 W67 48.357 5000m! (16,500 feet): Maybe the highest customs office in the world!  Nothing needed, simply hand over your temporary vehicle importation permit, they give you nothing in return either.  Trash can near parking.</p>
<p>Note: just before the hot springs there is an optional side trip you can take to explore the northeast section of the park.  See Optional Side Trips below for more information.</p>
<p>Hot Springs Camp beside Laguna Chalviri, S22 32.071 W67 38.940 4393m: Superb spot next to 29C hot springs.  The geography gives you a bit of a break from the wind.  The hot springs are crowded during breakfast and lunch time but wait an hour and you will have them to enjoy in solitude.  Hot springs are free to use, bathrooms cost B/3, there are trash cans and snacks for sale across the road.</p>
<p>Laguna Verde Camp, S22 48.188 W67 49.732 4369m: Overlooking the lake and famous Volcan Licancabur (5960m).  If the wind is low this would be a better spot overlooking the lake: S22 47.180 W67 49.051.  The guidebook suggests you can find a guide “hanging around Laguna Verde” if you’d like to climb Licancabur.  We sure didn’t see anybody hanging around.  Arrange in advance or from San Pedro if you plan to climb anything.</p>
<p>Southern Ticket Control, S22 49.881 W67 46.744 4360m: Here they will check your park ticket to ensure it is still valid.  There seems to be a very simple hosteria here also.</p>
<p>Bolivian Immigration, S22 52.856 W67 47.905: Get your Bolivian exit stamp here at the border.  No paperwork or copies needed.</p>
<p>San Pedro de Atacama is 49km after the border and all down hill.  The crashed and burnt trucks on the side of the road serve as good reminders to down shift!</p>
<p>Chile Aduana &amp; Immigration, S22 54.641 W68 11.630: Simple check-in procedures, get you passport stamped then move to the next window and get your vehicle imported.  Nothing to it.  Just bring your original vehicle title and passport, no copies needed.  This does include a vehicle search where they take all meats, fresh fruit, and fresh vegetables.</p>
<p>See section on San Pedro for GPS coordinates for gas station and camping</p>
<div id="attachment_2589" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/IMG_0321.jpg" rel="shadowbox[sbpost-2578];player=img;" title="Sunset"><img class="size-full wp-image-2589" title="Sunset" src="https://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/IMG_0321.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Sunset at camp</p></div>
<p><em>Side Trips</em></p>
<p>Before you reach the park boundaries you will see tracks leading in every direction.  They will take you to even further removed mountain ranges, lakes, and valleys.  We struck off down a few and really enjoyed leaving the tracks and discovering more.  If you’re the wandering explorer type, you may never run out of tracks.</p>
<p>Once in the park there is one side trip we considered but did not take due to our gas range.  Just before the hot springs there is a road leading to the small settlement of Quetena Chico.  In the village there is rumored to be a hostel with hot shower (S22 11.732 W67 20.426).  Along the way you’ll pass by more lakes, including Laguna Celeste, and incredible scenery.  Once you have arrived you can take the world’s highest motorable road winding it’s way up Volcan Uturunca (6020m).  The road tops out at 5900m, 200m higher than the road over the Khardung La in India.</p>
<p>Side note: the continent’s highest pass, is just south of here on RN40 in Argentina.</p>
<p><em>GPS Maps</em> [add links]</p>
<p>Bolivia seems to have the worst GPS map options in South America.  Your choices for the southwest corner of Bolivia are as follows:</p>
<p>Open Street Maps (OSM): This seems to be the most accurate but is missing some roads and a lot of features.</p>
<p>Mapear V9.40: Great for Chile and Argentina but only has the far Sothern portion of the Lagunas Route (no Salar or Uyuni).</p>
<p>Ruta Bolivia v3.5 (BOL Map 3.5): We found this to be the best.  The map is very difficult to find online (we had to register for a couple online forums before we could download).  It is loaded directly to the GPS and cannot be loaded into MapSource.  This map is missing some roads but has many features including good topo information and mountains (for a road map).</p>
<p><em>Lagunas Route Weather</em></p>
<p>Each of our seven days in October were warm and sunny.  About every other day we woke up to an enjoyable calm morning.  On the other days and every afternoon the wind blows constantly.  Every night it froze hard.  Overnight lows hit the single digits (-12C).</p>
<div id="attachment_2640" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/IMG_9945.jpg" rel="shadowbox[sbpost-2578];player=img;" title="Salar de Uyuni Sunset"><img class="size-full wp-image-2640" title="Salar de Uyuni Sunset" src="https://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/IMG_9945.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Sunset on the Salar</p></div>
<p><strong>San Pedro de Atacama, Chile (8,330 feet / 2540 m)</strong></p>
<p>Although there’s only one gas station in town, a Copec at S22 54.802 W68 11.930, San Pedro will seem like Mecca compared to Uyuni.  The popular camp for overlanders is Los Perales (S22 54.793 W68 12.040) which offers electricity, solar showers, and a climbing wall on a dirt lot [C:4,000/per person C:2,000 for elec; ~$20US].</p>
<p>There are a few ATMs in town, all which seem to run out of cash by the end of the weekend.  There are numerous cafes and bars with great food and wifi.  The town center has free wifi also.  There are a number of corner stores, but no proper grocery store.</p>
<p>Once recharged in town, the Atacama Desert surrounding San Pedro offers a whole different menu of options for overlanders.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p><em>Part two of a three part series on Bolivia’s wild and wonderful Southwest Circuit.</em></p>
<p>Journal entry dated October nineteenth, twenty-eleven.  Location: 100km north of the Eduardo Avaroa National Reserve boundary.</p>
<p>Plumes of frigid breath float to the ceiling as we lay bundled in our cocoon of blankets and sleeping bags. The sun made her welcome presence known through the camper windows over an hour ago. Yet the temperature gauge stands firm at <strong>15 degrees</strong>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Part two of a three part series on Bolivia’s wild and wonderful Southwest Circuit.</em></p>
<p>Journal entry dated October nineteenth, twenty-eleven.  Location: 100km north of the Eduardo Avaroa National Reserve boundary.</p>
<div id="attachment_2563" style="width: 443px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/IMG_0204-1.jpg" rel="shadowbox[sbpost-2485];player=img;" title="The road less traveled"><img class="size-full wp-image-2563  " title="The road less traveled" src="https://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/IMG_0204-1.jpg" alt="" width="433" height="598" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Possibilities, endless</p></div>
<p>Plumes of frigid breath float to the ceiling as we lay bundled in our cocoon of blankets and sleeping bags. The sun made her welcome presence known through the camper windows over an hour ago. Yet the temperature gauge stands firm at <strong>15 degrees</strong>.</p>
<p>The low grumble of a hungry stomach kick starts the morning and motivates us into life. An attempt at goulash the previous evening, using ground beef bought in Uyuni’s central market, ended in disaster. The dusty town sits at 12,000’ and come to think of it, there wasn’t a single cow in sight. Two bites in, we found ourselves wondering exactly what we were ingesting, a third bite was deemed unnecessary.</p>
<div id="attachment_2501" style="width: 210px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/IMG_0328.jpg" rel="shadowbox[sbpost-2485];player=img;" title="Wakey wakey, eggs and bakey"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2501" title="Wakey wakey, eggs and bakey" src="https://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/IMG_0328-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Cold weather camping requires a hearty morning kickstart</p></div>
<p>The gentlest nudge of the thermostat and the heater is roaring. Seconds later, the flame is burning bright beneath the blue coffee percolator and all thoughts of hiding beneath the covers vanish. A hearty breakfast is in order, dark coffee, eggs, bacon, and toast.  The American way.</p>
<p><strong>We are camped on the altiplano, 200 feet higher than the 48 states highest peak</strong> &#8211; Mt. Whitney. The landscape is harsh, but unlike Uyuni, we are enveloped in unbelievable beauty. Sharp, jagged, peaks dusted with snow neighbor modest hillsides which appear to be formed using a delicate mixture of honey, cream, and burnt sugar; dolloped expertly into the foreground, a visual feast.</p>
<div id="attachment_2506" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/IMG_0393.jpg" rel="shadowbox[sbpost-2485];player=img;" title="Like honey"><img class="size-full wp-image-2506 " title="Like honey" src="https://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/IMG_0393.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="378" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Sugar Mountains</p></div>
<p>Breakfast and coffee consumed, our spirits have warmed considerably. But outside, it’s still freezing. The morning is calm and quiet, unique for the Bolivian altiplano where the whine and whistle of wind is almost constant.</p>
<p>Taking advantage of the calm weather, Logan sets about fastening the solar shower to the camper. The outside temperature is still below 50 degrees but at this altitude, <strong>the sun’s rays warm you to the core</strong>.</p>
<p>Miles away, a convoy of three fully loaded land cruisers ignite a dusty trail. Where they’ve been and where they’ll go is whipped up into the wind, the landscape leaves it&#8217;s mark as each vehicle turns a soft shade of dirt brown.</p>
<div id="attachment_2512" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/IMG_0605.jpg" rel="shadowbox[sbpost-2485];player=img;" title="True Grit"><img class="size-full wp-image-2512" title="True Grit" src="https://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/IMG_0605.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="534" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">True Grit</p></div>
<p>The sun hasn’t had much time to warm our shower and the water prompts a sharp inhale of breath the second it hits the skin. There’s something spectacular about showering in the open wilderness of this beautiful country, bare as the day we were born, surrounded by snowy peaks and rolling hills.  <strong>No doubt, this is the best shower of our lives.</strong></p>
<div id="attachment_2502" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/IMG_0337.jpg" rel="shadowbox[sbpost-2485];player=img;" title="Sun shower"><img class="size-full wp-image-2502" title="Sun shower" src="https://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/IMG_0337.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="352" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">It may not warm the skin but it certainly warms the soul</p></div>
<p>To be sure, we are clean and totally awake by now. We pack it up and move south toward the Eduardo Avaroa National Park in Bolivia’s southwest corner. Several times the road turns violently rocky, 4WD low is engaged to pull us up through the canyon. The terrain is schizophrenic, a few minutes after the rocks we pass a snow field, and minutes later we&#8217;re struggling through fine sand.</p>
<div id="attachment_2503" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/IMG_0347.jpg" rel="shadowbox[sbpost-2485];player=img;" title="Rocky terrain"><img class="size-full wp-image-2503" title="Rocky terrain" src="https://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/IMG_0347.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="534" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Things get technical</p></div>
<div id="attachment_2505" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/IMG_0388.jpg" rel="shadowbox[sbpost-2485];player=img;" title="Lost vaquero"><img class="size-full wp-image-2505" title="Lost vaquero" src="https://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/IMG_0388.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="382" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Lost vaquero</p></div>
<p>It’s at about this point in the day we start congratulating ourselves for getting so far out there. And we are, there’s not a soul in sight, there’s not even a road. <strong>We’re literally making our own tracks. This is what it’s all about.</strong>  Then in the distance, a speck on the horizon halts the conversation. What is that? The speck turns out to be a lone bicyclist with loaded saddlebags, huffing his way through the barely maneuverable sand that is our latest terrain.</p>
<div id="attachment_2507" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/IMG_0449.jpg" rel="shadowbox[sbpost-2485];player=img;" title="Cheesehead on the loose"><img class="size-full wp-image-2507" title="Cheesehead on the loose" src="https://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/IMG_0449.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="534" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Cheesehead on the loose</p></div>
<p>This is Matt from Wisconsin, a self proclaimed cheesehead who left home 18 months ago. He plans to circle the South American continent before returning home. Guys like Matt remind us that bad ass adventures can always be one upped in the awesome department. We tip our nomadic hats to you sir.</p>
<div id="attachment_2496" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/IMG_0190.jpg" rel="shadowbox[sbpost-2485];player=img;" title="6 inches"><img class="size-full wp-image-2496" title="6 inches" src="https://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/IMG_0190.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="534" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Another six inches and we would have been in deep without a snorkel</p></div>
<p>Back in the air conditioned cab we relish the easy comforts of The Beast. We are members of a tribe where driving the PanAm is cool for your honeymoon but doesn’t exactly guarantee you a seat at the round table. <strong>This sets off our daily conversation on future exploits </strong>and soon the blood red Laguna Colorada comes into view.</p>
<div id="attachment_2509" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/IMG_0479.jpg" rel="shadowbox[sbpost-2485];player=img;" title="Laguna Colorada"><img class="size-full wp-image-2509" title="Laguna Colorada" src="https://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/IMG_0479.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="534" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Eerie doesn&#39;t begin to describe it</p></div>
<p>At the entrance to the park we fork over the 150 Boliviano (US$20) fee per person. <strong>This is more than the average Bolivian earns in one week.</strong>  The park ranger has few words for us, offering only warnings on what we cannot do and where we cannot camp. This seems oddly familiar.</p>
<div id="attachment_2498" style="width: 792px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/IMG_0265.jpg" rel="shadowbox[sbpost-2485];player=img;" title="Getting a better look"><img class="size-full wp-image-2498" title="Getting a better look" src="https://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/IMG_0265.jpg" alt="" width="782" height="494" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Going in for a closer view of the flamingos</p></div>

<p>We find a campsite with a view, taking in two angles of the lake we seem to be totally surrounded by bright pink flamingos. It’s windy as hell and in no time we have the camper popped up, coca tea brewing, and soup at a boil.</p>
<div id="attachment_2508" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/IMG_0462.jpg" rel="shadowbox[sbpost-2485];player=img;" title="Afternoons"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2508" title="Afternoons" src="https://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/IMG_0462-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Reading hour turns to cocktail hour</p></div>
<p>Tourists jam packed into land cruisers with balding tires continue pulling up throughout the afternoon. We’re warm and content inside the camper, reading away the last few hours of sunlight. Just waiting until we have the red lake completely to ourselves. <strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>The sun sets. The Havana Club is poured. The deck of cards shuffled.<br />
</strong></p>
<p>Just another day in the life. Overlanders, over and out.</p>

<div id="attachment_2520" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/IMG_0052.jpg" rel="shadowbox[sbpost-2516];player=img;" title="First Look"><img class="size-full wp-image-2520" title="First Look" src="https://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/IMG_0052.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="443" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Getting our first salty taste</p></div>
<p>The Salar de Uyuni was our first stop on a ten day journey throughout Bolivia’s incredible southwestern circuit. After stocking up on supplies and fuel, we struck out from the dusty town of Uyuni, <strong>a true tumbleweed outpost if there ever was one</strong>.</p>
<p>Planning a 25,000 mile journey sounds like an impossible task. People often ask how we could route such a lengthy course. The answer is, <strong>we don’t</strong>. Our planning goes country by country, often day by day. There are, however, highlights that have been on the map since the beginning. <strong>The Salar de Uyuni is one of them</strong>.</p>
<div id="attachment_2529" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/IMG_9915.jpg" rel="shadowbox[sbpost-2516];player=img;" title="Camper view"><img class="size-full wp-image-2529" title="Camper view" src="https://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/IMG_9915.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="534" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">View from the camper window</p></div>
<p>The Salar de Uyuni was formed 30,000 years ago when Lago Minchin, which covered the majority of southwestern Bolivia, dried up leaving a few small lakes and two large salt concentrations in it’s wake. With no outlets to the sea, the Salar is a result of the lake leaching minerals from nearby mountains. The minerals settle at the lowest possible point, creating <strong>an eerie endless plane of flat, pure white, salt</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>12,100 square km (4,688 square mi)</li>
<li>Largest salt flat in the world</li>
<li>Produces 20,000 tons of salt each year</li>
<li>Estimated to contain 50-70% of the world’s lithium ion reserves</li>
</ul>
<div id="attachment_2521" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/IMG_0055.jpg" rel="shadowbox[sbpost-2516];player=img;" title="A man and his truck"><img class="size-full wp-image-2521" title="A man and his truck" src="https://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/IMG_0055.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="534" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">A man and his truck</p></div>
<p>Five kilometers before the Salar, <strong>we heard a loud clanging and the terrible sound of yet another broken bolt</strong> from the suspension airbag. At this point in the trip, adjusting the airbags is a bit of a routine. Logan was under the truck for barely fifteen minutes, faulty suspension airbags, our new morning ritual.</p>
<div id="attachment_2526" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/IMG_9772.jpg" rel="shadowbox[sbpost-2516];player=img;" title="Airbag woes"><img class="size-full wp-image-2526" title="Airbag woes" src="https://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/IMG_9772.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="534" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Fortunately our truck came with it&#39;s own portable mechanic, very handy</p></div>
<p>When driving onto the surface for the first time, you can’t help but think your truck is testing the limits of a dangerous ice covered lake. The salt appears cracked and withered, indeed the Salar is dotted with watery holes perpetuating the illusion of frozen water. 1km in, <strong>incomprehensible whiteness</strong> takes over.</p>
<div id="attachment_2522" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/IMG_0067.jpg" rel="shadowbox[sbpost-2516];player=img;" title="Planet Earth?"><img class="size-full wp-image-2522" title="Planet Earth?" src="https://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/IMG_0067.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="534" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Surreal horizon</p></div>
<p>Over the course of three days we circled the Salar taking in the wide open nothingness.  The sunsets were truly amazing. The morning was the only time the steady wind let up.  <strong>We were up with the sun and took in the most breathtaking sunrise yet</strong>.  We hiked the cactus covered islands, constantly awestruck by the white expanse surrounding us.</p>
<div id="attachment_2524" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/IMG_0132.jpg" rel="shadowbox[sbpost-2516];player=img;" title="Sunset on the Salar"><img class="size-full wp-image-2524" title="Sunset on the Salar" src="https://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/IMG_0132.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="534" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Sunset on the Salar</p></div>

<p>Because there is little variation on the stark white surface, and almost no competing background, perspective can be easily skewed. Accordingly, we took full advantage.</p>
<div id="attachment_2527" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/IMG_9820.jpg" rel="shadowbox[sbpost-2516];player=img;" title="I work out"><img class="size-full wp-image-2527" title="I work out" src="https://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/IMG_9820.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="534" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">I&#39;ll just set this over...here!</p></div>

<p>Among the many travel warnings, the fact that <strong>no one</strong> mentioned the man eating dinosaurs still roaming the altiplano of Bolivia is disturbing. You heard it here first, folks. <strong>Bolivia is a terrifyingly dangerous place</strong>. Dinosaurs will eat you and destroy your vehicle.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We booked it out of La Paz anxious to explore more of Bolivia’s wild land.  We had heard Bolivia referred to as the Tibet of the Americas due to it’s isolation, altitude, and rugged terrain.  We had a taste of it in <a href="https://panamnotes.com/2011/10/sorata/" target="_blank">Sorata</a>, but we craved more.  <strong>Our decision to fork over $270 in visa fees was not for the hip modernity of La Paz but the wild frontier.</strong></p>
<p>In that spirit we referred to our paper map and marked Sajama along the Chilean border as our next destination.  With it’s plains sitting above 14,000 feet (4350m) the park houses the world’s highest “forest,” and Bolivia’s highest peak, Volcán Sajama (6542m).  The forest may be underwhelming as the dwarf queñua trees more resemble bushes, but <strong>the landscape consumes the senses</strong>.  Sajama was Bolivia’s first National Park.</p>
<div id="attachment_2465" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/10-8-Upload-010.jpg" rel="shadowbox[sbpost-2464];player=img;" title="The road to paradise is rarely paved"><img class="size-full wp-image-2465" title="The road to paradise is rarely paved" src="https://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/10-8-Upload-010.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="447" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The road to paradise is rarely paved</p></div>
<p>Calling it a National Park is an insult to anybody familiar with the US National Park Service.  To camp in Yosemite on any given weekend requires a <strong>well executed reservation</strong>.  If you want to climb Mount Whitney, you’ll find yourself entering a <strong>lottery</strong>.  Rafting the Grand Canyon? Prepare to cough up Oprah dough or get your name on the <strong>waiting list</strong> and sit tight, for 20 years.</p>
<p>In Sajama, $4.00 gets you unbridled access.  Drive, camp, hike wherever  you damn well please.  This is Bolivia, wild and free.</p>
<div id="attachment_2466" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/10-8-Upload-057.jpg" rel="shadowbox[sbpost-2464];player=img;" title="Gettin wet"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2466" title="Gettin wet" src="https://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/10-8-Upload-057-300x159.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="159" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">We do love water crossings</p></div>
<p>Our first night we camped alongside 95 degree hot springs and among the mountain majesty.  For two days we proceeded to empty the contents of our food-poisoned stomachs outside the camper.  We wish we could swear off those golden crisp salteñas, but we know we’ll be back.</p>
<div id="attachment_2467" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/10-8-Upload-034.jpg" rel="shadowbox[sbpost-2464];player=img;" title="Hot Springs"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2467" title="Hot Springs" src="https://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/10-8-Upload-034-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Nearby hot springs, even the alpacas can&#39;t resist</p></div>
<div id="attachment_2468" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/10-8-Upload-036.jpg" rel="shadowbox[sbpost-2464];player=img;" title="Our kind of National Park"><img class="size-full wp-image-2468" title="Our kind of National Park" src="https://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/10-8-Upload-036.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="534" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Feeling better already</p></div>
<p>A recovery dip in the hot springs certainly had us believing in their much rumored curative powers.  We spent two more days circling the park taking in the harsh landscape. Sparse barbed-wire fences crisscross the park but unraveling them took only minutes allowing us to move on to every trail we felt like exploring.</p>
<div id="attachment_2469" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/10-8-Upload-079.jpg" rel="shadowbox[sbpost-2464];player=img;" title="Campsite Dos in Sajama"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2469 " title="Campsite Dos in Sajama" src="https://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/10-8-Upload-079-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The stuff John Denver songs are made of</p></div>
<p>The dirt back-roads and isolation had us laughing about our days in Yosemite just one year ago. We recalled the stress of getting to our  reservation on time, held up in traffic jams of minivans, a camera pointed out of every window; all curated  by a vast army of badges, trained for, but ultimately deemed too uptight to fight in the War on Terror. Under the outdated title of park ranger, they gleefully issue infractions to ensure <strong>nothing wild happens out in our wilderness</strong>. (1)</p>
<div id="attachment_2470" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/10-8-Upload-091.jpg" rel="shadowbox[sbpost-2464];player=img;" title="Chilly"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2470" title="Chilly" src="https://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/10-8-Upload-091-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">A frozen morning and a frozen sink</p></div>
<p>In contrast, at 4350m the wind runs icy cold, the afternoon sun blazes, and a hard freeze takes over each and every night.  Our only company were the herds of alpaca, not sure what to make of a camper meandering along their desolate prairie.  Returning to the wilderness <strong>we shed our illusions of grandeur and invincibility</strong>. We come closer to something more genuine, a more primal self.</p>
<div id="attachment_2471" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/10-8-Upload-096.jpg" rel="shadowbox[sbpost-2464];player=img;" title="Lakeside"><img class="size-full wp-image-2471" title="Lakeside" src="https://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/10-8-Upload-096.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="534" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">It&#39;s a great day to be alive</p></div>
<p>(1) We must issue an apology to the one decent park ranger we have met in our many years exploring the US parks. He was stationed at Olympia National Park in Washington state and was a true patriot, a throwback from the golden era of the US Park System (circa 1960). Big thanks to our nameless friend in Washington.</p>
