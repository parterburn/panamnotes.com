<div id="attachment_3421" style="width: 459px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Zombie16.jpg" rel="shadowbox[sbpost-3411];player=img;" title="Night of the Living Dead"><img class="size-small-feature wp-image-3421" title="Night of the Living Dead" src="https://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Zombie16-449x300.jpg" alt="" width="449" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Returning to life?</p></div>
<p>We quizzed our veteran overland friends on the homecoming and transition process. The general consensus was bleak.  We just spent 15 months living out our wildest dream and the hangover from that sustained high was sure to be severe.</p>
<p>For the last three years our mission, mantra, purpose could be summed up in five letters: <strong>PAN AM</strong>.  Once you board that plane, it’s all over.</p>
<div id="attachment_3413" style="width: 459px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_8375.jpg" rel="shadowbox[sbpost-3411];player=img;" title="Homeward Bound"><img class="size-small-feature wp-image-3413 " title="Homeward Bound" src="https://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_8375-449x300.jpg" alt="" width="449" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Mixed emotions on the plane home</p></div>
<p>We left a lot of ourselves out there on the road less traveled.  Our egos and identities would be in dire need of substance.  Like the first days on the PanAm we would be green and vulnerable.</p>
<p>Yet in place of the anticipated misery, we find ourselves oddly content. Serving up country coffee at the local diner and wrangling cattle under the warm Nebraska sun, <strong>you won&#8217;t find us without a smile.</strong> This new version of the United States that we left behind has us smitten.</p>
<p>Sipping coffee on our front porch in the morning we discuss the past journey and it fills us with immense joy and emotion. Heading south from San Francisco on that cold January morning in 2010 was the best decision we’ve made yet. <strong>It is changing our lives and our being in ways we are still becoming accustomed to.</strong></p>
<div id="attachment_3414" style="width: 2764px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_8555.jpg" rel="shadowbox[sbpost-3411];player=img;" title="Home Sweet Home"><img class="size-full wp-image-3414" title="Home Sweet Home" src="https://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_8555.jpg" alt="" width="2754" height="1867" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Our home on the plains</p></div>
<p>A 22,000 mile self supported journey to the end of the world feels like a jumping off point for infinite adventure. The PanAm was just the first of many. Casually throwing around &#8220;impossible&#8221; ideas is our new normal.</p>
<p>For the first time we have a big crazy goal over and done.  Accomplished. Behind us.  Luckily we don’t need to talk about it, because we don’t. For whatever reason, everybody we run into is <strong>more concerned about our future than the trip</strong>.  And that’s just fine with us because we are too.</p>
<div id="attachment_3415" style="width: 659px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Over-and-Out-Tweet.jpg" rel="shadowbox[sbpost-3411];player=img;" title="tweet tweet"><img class="size-full wp-image-3415" title="tweet tweet" src="https://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Over-and-Out-Tweet.jpg" alt="" width="649" height="275" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Over and Out</p></div>
<p>Thank you for being a part of our journey. If you take just one thing away from PanAmNotes please let it be this:<strong> Stop whatever you&#8217;re doing and throw yourself at the wildest idea you can muster up. </strong><em>¡Vamos!</em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The first visions we had of driving down the Pan-American Highway had us in a rescue orange, late model Sportsmobile complete with ladder and yakima racks.  That very model went up for sale on the Sportsmobile website and haunted us for weeks.  We bent the budget numbers like an Enron executive in an attempt to justify the $70,000 purchase.  Reality soon set in and we realized we could equip and fund the trip for nearly half that.</p>
<div id="attachment_981" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/orange-crush.jpg" rel="shadowbox[sbpost-975];player=img;" title="Orange Crush"><img class="size-medium wp-image-981" title="Orange Crush" src="https://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/orange-crush-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The stuff dreams are made of</p></div>
<p>Toyota was chosen on account of it&#8217;s expansive service network around the world.  While the Tundra is built in and exclusively for the US, should anything go wrong, the network will never be far.  While on the road we have already passed a number of authorized dealers.  Additionally, Toyota is a company with a history of vehicles that surpass the 200,000 mile mark.  And with our equipment budget, we just might see it.</p>
<p>Next, we briefly debated a Tundra versus a Tacoma.  Both would make exceptional platforms, but our need to haul a truck camper in the bed ended it quickly.  The payload rating in the Tundra is approximately 700 pounds greater than the Tacoma.  Some other advantages such as the larger fuel tank, roomy interior, access cab doors, and V8 engine also helped.  Even if we had gone the route of a sleeping platform or Flip Pac, we would have stuck with the Tundra for these reasons.</p>
<div id="attachment_989" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="https://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/IMG_8527.jpg" rel="shadowbox[sbpost-975];player=img;" title="The Beast"><img class="size-medium wp-image-989" title="The Beast" src="https://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/IMG_8527-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">On the dirt roads of Costa Rica</p></div>
<p>When shopping around for first generation Tundras we specifically sought out the 2003 and later models.  In 2003 Toyota addressed a number of minor issues with the engine (O2 sensor and exhaust manifold) and frankly, improved the looks.  Additionally the factory towing package was improved in 2003 to include a heavy duty 130 amp alternator, 7 pin trailer connector, and most importantly, a transmission oil cooler.  We purchased a truck with the TRD <del>stickers</del> package but felt it was unnecessary as this upgrade only came with upgraded shocks, tuned suspension, and mud flaps.</p>
<p>In June 2010 we purchased  a 2003 4WD Tundra TRD with 110,000 miles and the maintenance and modifications began.  This was our laundry list of maintenance which we took straight from the manual.  It is everything that should have been done at the 90,000 mile service through the 150,000 mile service.  If you complete all of this yourself expect to spend more than a few weekends and at least $1,500.  If you have a mechanic handle the work, budget $3,000 &#8211; $4,000, the timing belt replacement alone will cost around a grand.</p>
<ol>
<li>Transmission flush, new filter, synthetic fluids</li>
<li>Replace differential and transfer case fluids</li>
<li>Synthetic engine oil, new oil filter, air filter, lube driveshaft</li>
<li>Top off brake and power steering fluids</li>
<li>Replace PCV Valve</li>
<li>New platinum spark plugs</li>
<li>New starter battery</li>
<li>Radiator flush</li>
<li>New windshield wiper blades</li>
<li>New front brake pads and upgraded rotors</li>
<li>New serpentine belt</li>
<li>Replace timing belt, tensioner, and water pump</li>
<li>Replace fuel cap gasket (common problem on the 2003 model)</li>
</ol>
<p>With the maintenance complete, on to the modifications.  In this department the sky is the limit and you could easily blow an entire trip budget on custom bumpers and suspension upgrades.  We felt that one dollar spent traveling is much more valuable than one dollar spent on upgrades, and, $2,000 can get you out of a lot of situations that 33 inch tires will not.  In that spirit here are the basics.</p>
<ol>
<li>4 new BFG All Terrai, Baja Champions (size: <strong></strong>265/70R16)</li>
<li>Heavy duty shocks (Bilstein HD)</li>
<li>Garmin GPS with WorldMaps and mount (model: Nuvi 755T)</li>
<li>Fire extinguisher</li>
<li>Emergency triangles</li>
<li>Battery pack with AC converter and emergency jumper (our Duracell Battery power pack 600 AC charger broke in the first month)</li>
<li>Fix a Flat in a can</li>
<li>Tire plug kit</li>
<li>License plate holder, tamper resistant</li>
<li>General mechanics tools</li>
<li>Chilton repair manual</li>
<li>Tow rope</li>
<li>First Aid Kit</li>
<li>Great alarm system</li>
<li>Extra serp belt (and any other part you can get your hands on)</li>
<li>Spare oil filter</li>
<li>Patterned lug nut locks</li>
<li> Axe, shovel, jerrycan, water container</li>
<li>Air compressor</li>
<li>Check engine code reader</li>
</ol>
<p>Modifications to accommodate a truck camper or heavy load.</p>
<ol>
<li>Upgraded tires, Load Series D or E</li>
<li>Firestone ride-rite air helper springs</li>
<li>Rubber bed mat</li>
</ol>
<p>This is part one of a series we are doing on overland tech.  Stay tuned for a 5,000 mile update and a post on preparing you truck camper for international overland travel.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The veins of San Francisco stretch out across the city in every direction, pulsating life at all hours of the day and night. The N line rumbles the windows on Judah Street while the dirty 30 skulks through Chinatown. No matter where you are, MUNI echos its familiar song on every street and avenue. Twenty minutes, twice a day, the commute provides an escape form the routine it encompasses. Flash your bus pass, grab onto a handrail, and slip silently into the daydreams you slowly nurse to life each day.</p>
<div id="attachment_455" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Brown-Twins.jpg" rel="shadowbox[sbpost-420];player=img;" title="Brown Twins"><img class="size-medium wp-image-455" title="Brown Twins" src="https://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Brown-Twins-300x275.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="275" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The Brown Twins sporting San Francisco flair </p></div>
<p>These rails and routes connect us all.  When your stop is called, snap back to the reality that this is a city of one million strangers bonded by a common goal, dreaming big.  No concept, however seemingly impossible in scope or magnitude is immediately discarded. An idea as big as the Pan American Highway would quickly be dismissed among rational folk.  San Francisco is an incubator, nurturing the value in every crazy notion. Perhaps it is because we are so physically confined that we feel an undeniable urge to expand, to grow personally.</p>
<p>We often found the inspiration for personal expansion in the unforgettably eclectic mix of San Francisco neighborhoods and venues.  We will not soon forget the many 49&#8217;er rolls consumed at Nara Sushi on Polk, the &#8220;special shots&#8221; at Bow Bow&#8217;s in Chinatown, the romantic nights at Nob Hill Cafe, the legion of options we marveled over at Whiskey Thieves, the clinking of celebratory glasses at a number of fine establishments, followed by a lazy Sunday stroll to Art&#8217;s Cafe for their famous hash brown sandwich.  But most of all, we will miss the heartfelt discussions shared in the one bedroom apartments of our friends throughout the city.</p>
<div id="attachment_456" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/mini.jpg" rel="shadowbox[sbpost-420];player=img;" title="troy holden"><img class="size-medium wp-image-456" title="troy holden" src="https://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/mini-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text"> </p></div>
<p>At it&#8217;s heart, San Francisco is exactly what you decide to make of it.  A blank canvas of possibility, a pleasurable alienation.  You can remain a stranger in a strange land as long as you like and no matter how established you are as a person, anonymity is always just a train ride away.</p>
