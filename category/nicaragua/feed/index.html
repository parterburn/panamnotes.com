<p>Exiting Nicaragua early on a Saturday morning was a breeze. We entered just behind a large tourist bus and had a big line ahead of us at immigration. Coming from the Bay Area, waiting in line for various permissions and permits is a custom with which we are all too familiar. Bribery and extortion are rare here and making it through is merely a matter of getting yourself in front of the right official (they don&#8217;t stay in one place very long).</p>
<p>Entering Costa Rica was a bit more tedious with lines at each point, but the crossing itself turned out to be much more organized (and air conditioned) than we had read previously. Apparently both sides of the border view agents as a way to generate employment and downsizing has not yet been effected. You will have to find three agents to perform the same task. Later you will fill out a form for an agent to re-write in a notebook, for another agent to re-write on another form, for another agent to type up into an official permit. A smile and a decent amount of patience go a long way.</p>

<p>In the goose we found a few polished streets with potential but nothing that could hold our attention.  It reminded us of Antigua Guatemala with less Latin charm.  Venturing two blocks from the hostel rich town center in any direction revealed a different city and seedy locales.  We found two cities: one built for the tourists and one left to the locals.  Perhaps because we arrived with jaded attitudes (something not uncommon among overlanders) we imposed our negative vibes on the location.  Attitude is everything and it varies when you spend months bouncing around various countries.<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br />

<p>San Juan del Sur recharged our spirits.  A dispersed surf town with cheap barefoot bars quickly brought  back our love for Nica.  One evening we stayed out at Iguanas, a two story sandy beach bar, downing rum and cokes for a few hours and  were surprised when we got the $8US bar bill.  Nicaragua is a budgeter&#8217;s dream.</p>
<p>By the end of our time in San Juan del Sur we had the routine down and even found a hotel that let us camp under their palm trees next to the beach for an agreeable price.  We could have spent another week in Nicaragua but the allure of a gringified condo and familiar faces in Costa Rica pulled us reluctantly across the border.</p>
<blockquote><p>Gringofied Definition: a place south of the border in which you can flush toilet paper.</p></blockquote>
<p>Nica, our time was short but our experience long.  We left in love.</p>

<p>Once relaxed, we came to realize this as our new normal: driving country through country, exploring Latin American surf breaks and mountain towns.  Studying our guidebooks and maps, embracing the unknown ahead, and those moments of uneasy frustration and trepidation; we&#8217;ve been doing this for 60 days. Any departure from this routine would be foreign to us now.</p>
<div id="attachment_894" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/IMG_8274.jpg" rel="shadowbox[sbpost-880];player=img;" title="Drying racks"><img class="size-medium wp-image-894" title="Drying racks" src="https://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/IMG_8274-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Racks where they dry the wrapper leaves</p></div>
<p>Once in Esteli, we circled the cobblestone streets asking around for a room and parking. Esteli has a charm that flows through the streets and thus we found many young travelers among them. For the first time in two months we found nothing but full hostels. No problem however, the owner of Luna Hostel offered to put us up in her house four blocks from the bustling town center. After getting settled we sought out a wifi rich cafe to download our notes from the Honduras crossing for other overlanders to follow.</p>
<p>We eagerly typed out the guide, exchanging idea between one another alternating coffee and Tonas. When the guide was finished, we felt a bit prideful having conquered one of the small remaining unknown frontiers. Knowledge conquers corruption and we hope the guide enables others likewise. The feeling is lasting and we know we will seek it out again soon.</p>
<p>Smoking had been an uncommon social occurrence throughout our travels, but since Esteli is the number two tobacco growing region in the world, we found ourselves suddenly unable to escape the plumes of smoke emanating from every cafe and bar. A visit to this town would be incomplete without a tour of a local cigar factory. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"> </span>We met our tour guide and fellow tour member (a Scottish bloke) we were to take the cigar tour with at the hostel cafe. The Scotsman was a few weeks away from the end of  his six months round the world travel. He and his wife opted for adventure in place of a traditional wedding and honeymoon. It should not surprise our readers that we instantly got along.</p>
<div id="attachment_892" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/IMG_8269.jpg" rel="shadowbox[sbpost-880];player=img;" title="Our first tour conducted in Spanish"><img class="size-medium wp-image-892" title="Our first tour conducted in Spanish" src="https://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/IMG_8269-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">This is where the tobacco leaves are aged for up to one year</p></div>
<p>After lighting up some unlabeled grande puros from the stock room, we toured the numerous stages of cigar manufacturing. We were not surprised to learn the immense time and effort that goes into producing a single cigar. However, we were happily taken aback seeing each employee hard at work early on a Tuesday smiling from ear to ear, chatting with their neighbors, and rolling cigars with more speed and efficiency than any number crunching San Francisco cubicle dweller. There is not a scowl to be seen and each are proud to share their role in the process in Spanish dished out so fast we catch only every tenth word.</p>
<div id="attachment_893" style="width: 210px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/IMG_8310.jpg" rel="shadowbox[sbpost-880];player=img;" title="Lighting up in the stockroom"><img class="size-medium wp-image-893" title="Lighting up in the stockroom" src="https://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/IMG_8310-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Please disregard all &quot;No Fumar&quot; signage </p></div>
<p>Esteli impressed and provided yet another example of a city you could spend weeks in and never tire of the offerings. Ironic how one year of travel reminds us of all that we do not see. The more we travel the more we realize what we are missing, not the inverse.</p>
