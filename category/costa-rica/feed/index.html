				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This was our first non-weekend border crossing and we were slightly nervous this would mean the end of our luck painlessly hopping borders. Making our way from Pavones to Paso Canoas took about three and a half hours, setting our arrival time at noon. While we were examining the signs on the Costa Rica Aduana window explaining they had been closed the previous two days for a conference, an armed guard emerged from the bank next door to lock up for the two hour lunch break. Uh oh. We would not be the first travelers caught in a shady border town waiting out the lunch hour(s) in the heat of the day. Fortunately we had no use for the bank in Costa Rica and we quickly made our way to the Panamanian immigration building.</p>
<p>The few helpers who stuck around for the lunch hour followed us at a distance, waiting for the moment when we&#8217;d scratch our heads and furrow our brows. What a difference a few countries make. In Mexico and Guatemala we&#8217;re certain we acquired a few tiny dents from the helpers banging on the truck, anxious to provide their services. Fast forward to Costa Rica and the slick haired, Ray Ban wearing assistants calmly offered their services for $20 and left us alone when we said no gracias. When we finally did scratch our heads wondering where to obtain the vehicle permit stamp, they pointed us in the right direction free of charge.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The process took about an hour from start to finish and getting to David (for a propane fill up just east of town at Tropigas) and Boquete was a piece of cake. This was the easiest border crossing yet and we hear it only gets better in South America.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There is a special exhilaration involved in the re-reading of a favorite book. The hesitation, fearful of an unexpected disappointment in an old love, lingers only among the first few pages. While the plot line remains a reliable standby, the subtleties quietly transform with each read through. The adventures gain more thrill, the heartaches yield greater sorrow, and the final page renders a fresh significance previously obscured. In between the worn chapters rife with notes and shaky underlines, a tender new passion emerges.</p>
<p>We wanted a simple wedding, a quiet moment for the two of us to remember as ours alone. We hoped to sidestep the complicated agenda, seating charts, and entertaining a hundred or so guests. Our list of needs included a dress, a beach, and a legal officiant to declare us Mr. and Mrs. A few short weeks ago, our dreamy musings came to life on Playa Langosta.</p>
<p>Logan woke with the sun and set out to catch some early morning waves. Brianna indulged in coffee and a little Virginia Woolf<em> </em> on the deck. Without stress or distraction we spent the day relaxing  and clinking mimosa glasses with Connie and Jeff. When we finally dug  our toes into the sand and made our way down the isle, the sun was slipping slowly into the Pacific. A warm glow settled around us as we committed a lifetime of devotion to one another.</p>
<p>Perhaps it is one of our many tragic flaws as humans to believe a single read through encompasses us in complete understanding. Like the constantly evolving universe tucked away on our bookshelves, we must keep reading, keep reaching, keep challenging perspective and perception. As our own story evolves, the adventures, the setting, and the revolving cast of characters seem to materialize in a fashion stranger than fiction. Like a favorite book, our tale will grow more passionate with time, more humbling with the experience and adventure we seek out. As we write these pages now, we know we will look back to find a fresh beat, an allegory in constant metamorphosis.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Saying farewell to the beautiful beaches of Costa Rica was not easy. The landscape on the coast of this country is difficult to describe.  Comparing it with the fantastic images the imagination immediately conjures up just does not seem to do it justice.</p>
<p>Culturally, Costa Rica is somewhere between Mexico and California. Our Spanish routine slipped completely out of sight as just about everyone speaks excellent English. We took advantage of this surprising break from the Central American norm by trekking further off the beaten path than we have in any other country.</p>
<p>Tamarindo is a clear leader as a tourist destination but still maintains a high level of genuine surfer vibe. If you can get over the existence of a few high rise condominiums, there is a lot of charm and excellent surf breaks to be found. This is probably one of the best towns to set up camp for an extended time. As we discovered, you can spend two weeks here and still not see everything. Thanks to our wedding, we know we will be back.</p>
<p>Playa Hermosa had outstanding surf, too big for Logan and his board but lovely to watch at sunset. This was another beach town where we were thankful to have an AC unit in the camper. After meeting up with <a href="http://www.sprinterlife.com/" target="_blank">SprinterLife </a>we got some excellent recommendations for Uvita and Pavones. We found ourselves awestruck and lingering at <a href="http://www.tucanhotel.com/" target="_blank">Hotel Tucan</a> in Uvita. Each morning was sunny and gorgeous and when the rain hit mid-afternoon we retired to the common area for coffee, writing, and music. Uvita was the end of easy access beaches and we found Pavones at the end of a 2.5 hour pot-hole journey. The seclusion and remoteness give this beach a chilled out vibe that can&#8217;t be beat. The one cantina in town is positioned perfectly to view the second longest surf break in the world. There is something clean and untouched about Pavones and leads one to hope the road conditions never change, keeping it protected and serene.</p>
<p>There is an infrastructure built for travelers here. Because of their laws regarding real estate and citizenship, there is a thriving expat community which creates an entirely different atmosphere from the surrounding countries. This benefit comes with a downside though, one zip lining tour here costs the same as two full days of adventuring on the coast of Nicaragua. Despite the cost, we often found ourselves puzzling over the logistics of a full timer life in Costa Rica.</p>

The downpour reinforces our repetitive dogma for overlanding: there is  no perfect time. Just like five o&#8217;clock, it&#8217;s raining somewhere too,  and coincidentally, both are great excuses for a sundowner.</p>

<p>The camper, however, is not pleased.  Before leaving California I spent a Saturday coating every seam with sealant, sparing no sealant as I opted for function over beauty.  Despite this, we&#8217;re getting some water intrusion on the top front awning.  I have crawled around the roof looking for any imperfections and it looks solid.  I have even sought out answers online, but have been warned this is an inevitable perk in the wood-framed club.</p>
<div id="attachment_1043" style="width: 235px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Wet-Pal.jpg" rel="shadowbox[sbpost-1041];player=img;" title="Driver's side front awning"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1043" title="Driver's side front awning" src="https://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Wet-Pal-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Wet Siding</p></div>
<p>And then there are the roads.  We have made it a point to get well off  the beaten path in Costa Rica.  In the weeks since leaving Tamarindo we  have zigzagged between the mountains and the Pacific, getting deeper  with each destination.  Costa Rica is a small country, only about half  the size of Kentucky, but the winding dirt roads give the impression of a  vast nation.  The paved roads are so riddled with potholes we are  actually pleased when the pavement ends.</p>
<p>We may be a little wet but we are far from weary.</p>

<p>Cerro Chirripo, at 12,530 feet, is Costa Rica’s highest peak.  The crux of the climb may very well be merely getting to San Gerardo de Rivas, at the base of <a href="http://www.costarica-nationalparks.com/chirriponationalpark.html">Chirripo National Park</a>. We circled the northbound turnoff from the Pan-American (called the Inter Americana in Cost Rica) for an hour stopping to ask for directions a few times.  Each time the directions differed.  At our 4th stop along a rural dirt road nowhere near the turnoff, we got the correct beta.  Turn at the Maxi Bodega, there will be no sign.</p>
<p>San Gerardo de Rivas is a sleepy mountain town reminiscent of Aspen <em>100</em> years ago.  The one road to town is a rocky two hour uphill affair despite being only 20 kilometers from the highway.  Most of the locals use dirt bikes, horses, or ATVs for transportation.</p>
<p>We pass by the town&#8217;s 10 buildings, continuing north in search of the ideal campsite and find it only meters away from the Chirripo trailhead.  Hotel Uran is reluctant to allow us to camp out back, but we&#8217;re persistent.  Once established we both agree this is the best camping perch of the trip.</p>
<p>At 11,200 feet, an environmental research station, Base Crestones, allows up to 60  backpackers to sleep in its spare dormitory beds each night. Camping along the trail is forbidden.  Lacking a &#8220;reservation&#8221; we simply show up  outside the agency’s San Gerardo office to secure a spot the afternoon before the hike.  Many guidebooks recommend reserving a spot 10 weeks in advance but on this particular day they were barely up to a quarter of capacity.</p>
<p>From the trailhead, it’s nine miles to the Crestones research station. Nine miles and 6,700 feet of elevation gain.  My wife,  who is also a lover of the outdoors, comtemplates this and decides upon a better way to spend her solo days (soaking in the green surroundings and ravishing a few books) while I went marching up the mountain.  That aspect and a late start ensure solitude as I consider each foot of gain with my 25 pound pack.  It is utterly exhausting but the Great Outdoors are my place of worship and I am in seventh heaven walking among the clouds.</p>
<div id="attachment_1016" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/9.jpg" rel="shadowbox[sbpost-1012];player=img;" title="The Cloud Forest"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1016" title="The Cloud Forest" src="https://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/9-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The Cloud Forest</p></div>
<p>Before converting to an alpine savanna at 10,000 feet, the landscape is green and wet.  The dense cloud forest doesn&#8217;t allow for animal spotting, but a chorus of whistles, buzzing, and chirping accompany me along the trail.  After 8 hours of uphill, the green roof of the Base Crestones came into view.  The station has computers with wireless internet, cold-water showers, and bunks.  While passing the computers on the way to the mess hall, I give them the evil eye for following me to this altitude.</p>
<div id="attachment_1018" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/3.jpg" rel="shadowbox[sbpost-1012];player=img;" title="A sight for sore eyes"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1018" title="A sight for sore eyes" src="https://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/3-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">A sight for sore eyes</p></div>
<p>With the hard work behind me, I rise before the sun and enjoy a cup of instant Folgers as the sun emerges at 11,200 feet.  With most of the pack weight left behind at the station, I head north to tackle the final 2 miles to the summit.  From the valley I ask which of the majestic peaks ahead is the one that holds the honor of highest.  They remain stone silent, seeming to resent the concept of highest or better.  The trail takes a hard left and takes me up over a saddle and I see Chirripo for the first time not half a mile from her summit.</p>
<p>The morning air is crisp and clear during the final scramble.  At the top, both Pacific and Caribbean oceans can be seen.  I pause at the roof of Costa Rica for 45 minutes before it is all reversed and I&#8217;m back home, back at our camper.</p>
