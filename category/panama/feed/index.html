<p>The Darien Gap is a 100 mile stretch of <a title="FARC" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolutionary_Armed_Forces_of_Colombia" target="_blank">FARC</a> infested swampland dividing Panama and Colombia. The last successful overland vehicle crossing of this road-less wonder was completed in 741 days between 1985 and 1987. Did you catch that? <strong>Two years to travel 100 miles. </strong>Lacking unlimited time, we opted for a cargo ship which would haul our truck around the gap in just 24 hours.</p>
<p>What we assumed would be a $1000, one week ordeal transformed into a one month non-inclusive ($) course on Latin American Business Practices. The curriculum included Language Clarification (yes means maybe and no mean perhaps), Specialized Accounting for Budget Oversights, and Advanced Time Management with an emphasis in Official Stamp Accumulation.</p>
<p><strong>A detailed rundown of the process would only be a painful rendering of a string of unexciting let downs. </strong>We could go on for days about the ups and downs but really we&#8217;re just happy it&#8217;s over. And even more so, we are thrilled to be in South America. Once again, we have all our needs in the back of the pick up and all our desires laid out in the freedom of the open road ahead.</p>
<p>Special thanks go out to a few special people:</p>
<ul>
<li>Shaun at <a href="http://www.panamapassage.com/" target="_blank">Panama Passage</a> for giving us a home away from home and being a valued member of the Squeeze Team</li>
<li> Julio at <a href="http://www.panamasolucioneslogisticas.com/index_en.html" target="_blank">PSLI</a> for &#8220;making it happen&#8221;</li>
<li>Antonio in Cartagena for translating &#8220;absolutely not&#8221; into &#8220;ok, go ahead&#8221;</li>
<li><a href="http://www.adventurouspirits.com/" target="_blank">Tom &amp; Jan</a> for keeping us sane and finding the humor in every problema</li>

<p>We opted against creating a guide for shipping the gap because we wouldnÂ´t wish our situation on any other traveler. We did however throw together some helpful tips to potentially avoid the problems we encountered:</p>

<p>Santa Catalina is a one horse town that shares a singular Edge connection as their internet source. Despite this, it is the most revered surf spot in all of Panama. We both found out why first hand, jumping on Logan&#8217;s board and testing the playful waves which broke in long, rhythmic sets. This was the destination we dreamed about back in San Francisco. Camping on the sand, surfing all day, and watching surf films at night because an entire day catching waves could not satisfy our appetite.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After a steamy couple of days in Pavones Costa Rica, we set our sights on the sleepy mountain town of Boquete just across the Panama border. We were looking forward to a little tent camping and a cooler climate.</p>
<p>The town is a growing haven for retired expats and the tourism industry is booming. We took advantage with a trip to the Finca la Milagrosa coffee estate where we met Senior Tito, a man with true passion for the coffee seed. The loan officers of Panama did not share his vision for coffee production in this valley. With no financial support, Senior Tito took matters into his own hands and built most of the complicated machinery required out of his old Suzuki 4&#215;4. Today he is a world renown coffee producer and the name of his estate could not be more fitting,Â  translated it means the miraculous property. We left the three hour tour with a new appreciation for our morning ritual.</p>

<p>After the coffee tour we set out to explore Volcan Baru, Panama&#8217;s highest peak at 11,398 feet. We originally planned to summit the peak on foot but soon learned we could drive and could not resist the off-roading opportunity. We read Rick&#8217;s <a href="http://www.outscape.net/trip/archives/entries/rolling_the_jeep_on_volcan_baru.html" target="_blank">story</a> from 2001 and had visions of popping the camper top at the peak. Unfortunately, there was a good reason Rick rolled his jeep, and we were only able to make it to km marker 3. We put the truck in park at 7,500 feet and set out for an afternoon hike, exploring the area for a good campsite. With the wood chopped, sundowners poured, and the moon making her debut, we sat before our first campfire of the trip reminding each other exactly where we were on the planet.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This was our first non-weekend border crossing and we were slightly nervous this would mean the end of our luck painlessly hopping borders. Making our way from Pavones to Paso Canoas took about three and a half hours, setting our arrival time at noon. While we were examining the signs on the Costa Rica Aduana window explaining they had been closed the previous two days for a conference, an armed guard emerged from the bank next door to lock up for the two hour lunch break. Uh oh. We would not be the first travelers caught in a shady border town waiting out the lunch hour(s) in the heat of the day. Fortunately we had no use for the bank in Costa Rica and we quickly made our way to the Panamanian immigration building.</p>
<p>The few helpers who stuck around for the lunch hour followed us at a distance, waiting for the moment when we&#8217;d scratch our heads and furrow our brows. What a difference a few countries make. In Mexico and Guatemala we&#8217;re certain we acquired a few tiny dents from the helpers banging on the truck, anxious to provide their services. Fast forward to Costa Rica and the slick haired, Ray Ban wearing assistants calmly offered their services for $20 and left us alone when we said no gracias. When we finally did scratch our heads wondering where to obtain the vehicle permit stamp, they pointed us in the right direction free of charge.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The process took about an hour from start to finish and getting to David (for a propane fill up just east of town at Tropigas) and Boquete was a piece of cake. This was the easiest border crossing yet and we hear it only gets better in South America.</p>
