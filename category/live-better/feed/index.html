				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Despair.  Agony.  Devastation.  Mind numbing depression. We boarded the plane in São Paulo expecting the worst.</p>
<div id="attachment_3421" style="width: 459px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Zombie16.jpg" rel="shadowbox[sbpost-3411];player=img;" title="Night of the Living Dead"><img class="size-small-feature wp-image-3421" title="Night of the Living Dead" src="https://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Zombie16-449x300.jpg" alt="" width="449" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Returning to life?</p></div>
<p>We quizzed our veteran overland friends on the homecoming and transition process. The general consensus was bleak.  We just spent 15 months living out our wildest dream and the hangover from that sustained high was sure to be severe.</p>
<p>For the last three years our mission, mantra, purpose could be summed up in five letters: <strong>PAN AM</strong>.  Once you board that plane, it’s all over.</p>
<div id="attachment_3413" style="width: 459px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_8375.jpg" rel="shadowbox[sbpost-3411];player=img;" title="Homeward Bound"><img class="size-small-feature wp-image-3413 " title="Homeward Bound" src="https://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_8375-449x300.jpg" alt="" width="449" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Mixed emotions on the plane home</p></div>
<p>We left a lot of ourselves out there on the road less traveled.  Our egos and identities would be in dire need of substance.  Like the first days on the PanAm we would be green and vulnerable.</p>
<p>Yet in place of the anticipated misery, we find ourselves oddly content. Serving up country coffee at the local diner and wrangling cattle under the warm Nebraska sun, <strong>you won&#8217;t find us without a smile.</strong> This new version of the United States that we left behind has us smitten.</p>
<p>Sipping coffee on our front porch in the morning we discuss the past journey and it fills us with immense joy and emotion. Heading south from San Francisco on that cold January morning in 2010 was the best decision we’ve made yet. <strong>It is changing our lives and our being in ways we are still becoming accustomed to.</strong></p>
<div id="attachment_3414" style="width: 2764px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_8555.jpg" rel="shadowbox[sbpost-3411];player=img;" title="Home Sweet Home"><img class="size-full wp-image-3414" title="Home Sweet Home" src="https://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/IMG_8555.jpg" alt="" width="2754" height="1867" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Our home on the plains</p></div>
<p>A 22,000 mile self supported journey to the end of the world feels like a jumping off point for infinite adventure. The PanAm was just the first of many. Casually throwing around &#8220;impossible&#8221; ideas is our new normal.</p>
<p>For the first time we have a big crazy goal over and done.  Accomplished. Behind us.  Luckily we don’t need to talk about it, because we don’t. For whatever reason, everybody we run into is <strong>more concerned about our future than the trip</strong>.  And that’s just fine with us because we are too.</p>
<div id="attachment_3415" style="width: 659px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Over-and-Out-Tweet.jpg" rel="shadowbox[sbpost-3411];player=img;" title="tweet tweet"><img class="size-full wp-image-3415" title="tweet tweet" src="https://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Over-and-Out-Tweet.jpg" alt="" width="649" height="275" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Over and Out</p></div>
<p>Thank you for being a part of our journey. If you take just one thing away from PanAmNotes please let it be this:<strong> Stop whatever you&#8217;re doing and throw yourself at the wildest idea you can muster up. </strong><em>¡Vamos!</em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Part two of a three part series on Bolivia’s wild and wonderful Southwest Circuit.</em></p>
<p>Journal entry dated October nineteenth, twenty-eleven.  Location: 100km north of the Eduardo Avaroa National Reserve boundary.</p>
<div id="attachment_2563" style="width: 443px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/IMG_0204-1.jpg" rel="shadowbox[sbpost-2485];player=img;" title="The road less traveled"><img class="size-full wp-image-2563  " title="The road less traveled" src="https://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/IMG_0204-1.jpg" alt="" width="433" height="598" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Possibilities, endless</p></div>
<p>Plumes of frigid breath float to the ceiling as we lay bundled in our cocoon of blankets and sleeping bags. The sun made her welcome presence known through the camper windows over an hour ago. Yet the temperature gauge stands firm at <strong>15 degrees</strong>.</p>
<p>The low grumble of a hungry stomach kick starts the morning and motivates us into life. An attempt at goulash the previous evening, using ground beef bought in Uyuni’s central market, ended in disaster. The dusty town sits at 12,000’ and come to think of it, there wasn’t a single cow in sight. Two bites in, we found ourselves wondering exactly what we were ingesting, a third bite was deemed unnecessary.</p>
<div id="attachment_2501" style="width: 210px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/IMG_0328.jpg" rel="shadowbox[sbpost-2485];player=img;" title="Wakey wakey, eggs and bakey"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2501" title="Wakey wakey, eggs and bakey" src="https://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/IMG_0328-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Cold weather camping requires a hearty morning kickstart</p></div>
<p>The gentlest nudge of the thermostat and the heater is roaring. Seconds later, the flame is burning bright beneath the blue coffee percolator and all thoughts of hiding beneath the covers vanish. A hearty breakfast is in order, dark coffee, eggs, bacon, and toast.  The American way.</p>
<p><strong>We are camped on the altiplano, 200 feet higher than the 48 states highest peak</strong> &#8211; Mt. Whitney. The landscape is harsh, but unlike Uyuni, we are enveloped in unbelievable beauty. Sharp, jagged, peaks dusted with snow neighbor modest hillsides which appear to be formed using a delicate mixture of honey, cream, and burnt sugar; dolloped expertly into the foreground, a visual feast.</p>
<div id="attachment_2506" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/IMG_0393.jpg" rel="shadowbox[sbpost-2485];player=img;" title="Like honey"><img class="size-full wp-image-2506 " title="Like honey" src="https://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/IMG_0393.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="378" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Sugar Mountains</p></div>
<p>Breakfast and coffee consumed, our spirits have warmed considerably. But outside, it’s still freezing. The morning is calm and quiet, unique for the Bolivian altiplano where the whine and whistle of wind is almost constant.</p>
<p>Taking advantage of the calm weather, Logan sets about fastening the solar shower to the camper. The outside temperature is still below 50 degrees but at this altitude, <strong>the sun’s rays warm you to the core</strong>.</p>
<p>Miles away, a convoy of three fully loaded land cruisers ignite a dusty trail. Where they’ve been and where they’ll go is whipped up into the wind, the landscape leaves it&#8217;s mark as each vehicle turns a soft shade of dirt brown.</p>
<div id="attachment_2512" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/IMG_0605.jpg" rel="shadowbox[sbpost-2485];player=img;" title="True Grit"><img class="size-full wp-image-2512" title="True Grit" src="https://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/IMG_0605.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="534" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">True Grit</p></div>
<p>The sun hasn’t had much time to warm our shower and the water prompts a sharp inhale of breath the second it hits the skin. There’s something spectacular about showering in the open wilderness of this beautiful country, bare as the day we were born, surrounded by snowy peaks and rolling hills.  <strong>No doubt, this is the best shower of our lives.</strong></p>
<div id="attachment_2502" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/IMG_0337.jpg" rel="shadowbox[sbpost-2485];player=img;" title="Sun shower"><img class="size-full wp-image-2502" title="Sun shower" src="https://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/IMG_0337.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="352" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">It may not warm the skin but it certainly warms the soul</p></div>
<p>To be sure, we are clean and totally awake by now. We pack it up and move south toward the Eduardo Avaroa National Park in Bolivia’s southwest corner. Several times the road turns violently rocky, 4WD low is engaged to pull us up through the canyon. The terrain is schizophrenic, a few minutes after the rocks we pass a snow field, and minutes later we&#8217;re struggling through fine sand.</p>
<div id="attachment_2503" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/IMG_0347.jpg" rel="shadowbox[sbpost-2485];player=img;" title="Rocky terrain"><img class="size-full wp-image-2503" title="Rocky terrain" src="https://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/IMG_0347.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="534" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Things get technical</p></div>
<div id="attachment_2505" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/IMG_0388.jpg" rel="shadowbox[sbpost-2485];player=img;" title="Lost vaquero"><img class="size-full wp-image-2505" title="Lost vaquero" src="https://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/IMG_0388.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="382" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Lost vaquero</p></div>
<p>It’s at about this point in the day we start congratulating ourselves for getting so far out there. And we are, there’s not a soul in sight, there’s not even a road. <strong>We’re literally making our own tracks. This is what it’s all about.</strong>  Then in the distance, a speck on the horizon halts the conversation. What is that? The speck turns out to be a lone bicyclist with loaded saddlebags, huffing his way through the barely maneuverable sand that is our latest terrain.</p>
<div id="attachment_2507" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/IMG_0449.jpg" rel="shadowbox[sbpost-2485];player=img;" title="Cheesehead on the loose"><img class="size-full wp-image-2507" title="Cheesehead on the loose" src="https://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/IMG_0449.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="534" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Cheesehead on the loose</p></div>
<p>This is Matt from Wisconsin, a self proclaimed cheesehead who left home 18 months ago. He plans to circle the South American continent before returning home. Guys like Matt remind us that bad ass adventures can always be one upped in the awesome department. We tip our nomadic hats to you sir.</p>
<div id="attachment_2496" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/IMG_0190.jpg" rel="shadowbox[sbpost-2485];player=img;" title="6 inches"><img class="size-full wp-image-2496" title="6 inches" src="https://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/IMG_0190.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="534" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Another six inches and we would have been in deep without a snorkel</p></div>
<p>Back in the air conditioned cab we relish the easy comforts of The Beast. We are members of a tribe where driving the PanAm is cool for your honeymoon but doesn’t exactly guarantee you a seat at the round table. <strong>This sets off our daily conversation on future exploits </strong>and soon the blood red Laguna Colorada comes into view.</p>
<div id="attachment_2509" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/IMG_0479.jpg" rel="shadowbox[sbpost-2485];player=img;" title="Laguna Colorada"><img class="size-full wp-image-2509" title="Laguna Colorada" src="https://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/IMG_0479.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="534" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Eerie doesn&#39;t begin to describe it</p></div>
<p>At the entrance to the park we fork over the 150 Boliviano (US$20) fee per person. <strong>This is more than the average Bolivian earns in one week.</strong>  The park ranger has few words for us, offering only warnings on what we cannot do and where we cannot camp. This seems oddly familiar.</p>
<div id="attachment_2498" style="width: 792px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/IMG_0265.jpg" rel="shadowbox[sbpost-2485];player=img;" title="Getting a better look"><img class="size-full wp-image-2498" title="Getting a better look" src="https://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/IMG_0265.jpg" alt="" width="782" height="494" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Going in for a closer view of the flamingos</p></div>
<div id="attachment_2499" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/IMG_0273.jpg" rel="shadowbox[sbpost-2485];player=img;" title="Flamingos"><img class="size-full wp-image-2499" title="Flamingos" src="https://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/IMG_0273.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="534" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">One of many flamingo sightings while on the circuit</p></div>
<p>We find a campsite with a view, taking in two angles of the lake we seem to be totally surrounded by bright pink flamingos. It’s windy as hell and in no time we have the camper popped up, coca tea brewing, and soup at a boil.</p>
<div id="attachment_2508" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/IMG_0462.jpg" rel="shadowbox[sbpost-2485];player=img;" title="Afternoons"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2508" title="Afternoons" src="https://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/IMG_0462-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Reading hour turns to cocktail hour</p></div>
<p>Tourists jam packed into land cruisers with balding tires continue pulling up throughout the afternoon. We’re warm and content inside the camper, reading away the last few hours of sunlight. Just waiting until we have the red lake completely to ourselves. <strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>The sun sets. The Havana Club is poured. The deck of cards shuffled.<br />
</strong></p>
<p>Just another day in the life. Overlanders, over and out.</p>
<div id="attachment_2510" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/IMG_0554.jpg" rel="shadowbox[sbpost-2485];player=img;" title="Hot hot hot"><img class="size-full wp-image-2510 " title="Hot hot hot" src="https://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/IMG_0554.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="534" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Soaking up the hot springs at our next camp</p></div>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>Sitting at the breakfast table surrounded by tousle haired, caffeine hungry men, I quoted aloud the first line of my new book <em>Player Piano</em>. Unfortunately this was not my audience and I was met with blank stares and silence. After a moment Kelly piped in from across the room, &#8220;Is that Kurt Vonnegut?&#8221; I was awestruck.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sitting at the breakfast table surrounded by tousle haired, caffeine hungry men, I quoted aloud the first line of my new book <em>Player Piano</em>. Unfortunately this was not my audience and I was met with blank stares and silence. After a moment Kelly piped in from across the room, &#8220;Is that Kurt Vonnegut?&#8221; I was awestruck. I had read one sentence. &#8220;How could you possibly know that?&#8221; I asked, desperately trying to keep my jaw in it&#8217;s upright position to hide the fact that she had just completely won over my literary heart. &#8220;I dated his nephew.&#8221; This turned out to be one of the <strong>many</strong> great stories Kelly kept in her back pocket.</p>
<p>Cristian appeared moments later asking if any of the bleary eyed breakfast crew were going surfing today. We considered the sunless sky and the frigid temperature and shook our heads guiltily. Cristian is not a man who lives in the negative, especially when it comes to the surf. He scurried around the house preparing for the impending board meeting and before making his exit asked if anyone had changed their minds. We hadn&#8217;t, but we looked forward to hearing him wax philosophical on his oceanic exploits later that night&#8230;</p>
<p>After tossing a few back at a reggae show in Barranca, we were headed home when Cristian decided we needed one last stop. At 2AM we coasted onto Lima&#8217;s sandy stretch of beach and <strong>turned the volume up on our thoughts</strong>. We swapped philosophies on everything from travel, to love, to Jack Johnson. We learned about the mafia, we learned about Peru, we learned about Lima, we learned the good and bad side of Pisco, and we learned how <em>they</em> live better.</p>
<blockquote><p>Everyday I live my dream. Every day I live 100%. &#8211; &#8211; Cristian</p></blockquote>

<p>The good vibes and positive energy emanating from these two are absolutely contagious. As we pulled away from their place at <a href="http://www.peruroadtrip.com/" target="_blank">Peru Road Trip</a> the next day, we popped in Cristian&#8217;s latest surf mix and cruised through the city feeling mellow and happy. Listen to our favorite track <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmR7zOKsSR4" rel="shadowbox[sbpost-1869];player=swf;width=640;height=385;" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Sometimes living better is just a matter of learning better.</strong></p>

<p>Weekdays were spent camping and hiking in the mountains. Weekends were consumed with a startling pattern, ambitious attempts to visit every last bar Huaraz had to offer. In juxtaposition to our normal 10PM lights out, the bars here have no posted closing time. These late nights, made our 15,000&#8242; hikes all the more impressive. <strong>Our friends reminded us, even in a truck camper traveling the PanAm, life doesn&#8217;t have to be routine.</strong></p>

<p>After seven months in our own universe (population two), things can get a little skewed. Most PanAm Overlanders make a trip home at this point. Taking some time away from the road to re-group with family and friends is invaluable. Fortunately for us, <strong>home came to Peru</strong> in the form of Paul, Ty, and later Logan&#8217;s parents. We were in need of a re-alignment, a necessary connection to the lives we had disconnected from was in order. Many thanks gents for the shotskis, the Running with Milk &#8216;do, the Circle of Life karaoke, and the <strong>underwear antics</strong> (not pictured for obvious reasons).</p>
