<p>We crossed from Peru into Bolivia at the Yunguyo border town on a Sunday afternoon. This is a relaxed border mainly used for travel to Copacabana.

The Bolivian entry process was similarly quick, we were in and out in less than thirty minutes.</p>

<p>We crossed from Peru into Bolivia at the Yunguyo border town on a Sunday afternoon. This is a relaxed border mainly used for travel to Copacabana. There is a one hour time change between the two countries. We arrived at the Peruvian immigration office at 1PM (Peru time) and finished six minutes later. The Bolivian entry process was similarly quick, we were in and out in less than thirty minutes.</p>
<div id="attachment_2212" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Peru-Immigration-and-police-exit.jpg" rel="shadowbox[sbpost-2210];player=img;" title="Peruvian Immigration and Police Office"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2212" title="Peruvian Immigration and Police Office" src="https://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Peru-Immigration-and-police-exit-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Peruvian Immigration and Police Office</p></div>
<p>Drive all the way up to the chain barrier on the Peru side, park on the right. Get your tourist cards stamped at the police office (green building) across the street (left). Go next door to give up your tourist cards and obtain your exit stamps in the immigration office (yellow building). Go back across the street (right) to the white aduana building to give up your vehicle permit. We were not asked to produce any originals or copies at this point. You are now checked out of Peru.</p>
<p>Drive under the cement overhang and up to the iron gate, park on the right. Go to immigration for your entry stamps and visa. This step requires the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>$135 cash in US dollars per person (each bill will be inspected rigorously, no rips or tears)</li>
<li>2 color passport photos (2 inches x 2 inches)</li>
<li>Bolivian Visa <a href="http://www.boliviawdc.com/index.php?option=com_smartformer&amp;formid=18" target="_blank">Form</a></li>
<li>Bolivian tourist form obtained at immigration</li>
</ul>
<div id="attachment_2213" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Bolivia-Immigration-entry.jpg" rel="shadowbox[sbpost-2210];player=img;" title="Bolivia Immigration and Money Exchange"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2213" title="Bolivia Immigration and Money Exchange" src="https://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Bolivia-Immigration-entry-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Bolivia Immigration and Money Exchange</p></div>
<p>It is possible to show up at the border with just $135 US cash. You can complete all the necessary paperwork on the spot. Completing the visa form in advance online saves you some time. If you don&#8217;t have a picture for your visa they appear to have a large stash of leftover photos and will try to match you up as best they can with a stranger.</p>
<p>The above was all we needed, but the following additional items may be required depending on the border official&#8217;s mood:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hotel reservation</li>
<li>Country itinerary (both can be created in your email)</li>
<li>Yellow Fever vaccination card</li>
<li>Bank statement or copy of credit card proving economic solvency</li>
</ul>
<p>We did not have exact change for our visa fee which we heard was necessary but the officials provided change to us. Results may vary. We found that anticipating every step really speeds the process along and eliminates areas where a border official may require a bribe. We received a 90 day visa with no problems.</p>
<p>The white aduana building is up the hill to the left of the immigration office. In order to import your vehicle into Bolivia you will need to show your original title, a copy of your title, and a copy of your passport. We received 90 days on the import permit without issue. Our official stamped the form, opened the gate, and we were officially in Bolivia.</p>
<div id="attachment_2214" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Bolivia-Aduana-entry.jpg" rel="shadowbox[sbpost-2210];player=img;" title="Bolivia Aduana "><img class="size-medium wp-image-2214" title="Bolivia Aduana " src="https://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Bolivia-Aduana-entry-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Bolivia Aduana</p></div>
<p>Most people we&#8217;ve spoken with have had to find a police officer to provide a second stamp on the import permit and to open the gate. No such instruction was given to us!</p>
<p>At no point were we asked to pay anything other than the $135 visa fee. Nearly all of our border crossings have been on a Sunday afternoon. We feel this has played a role in our good luck with borders. On Fridays, border agents are thinking about funding their imminent bar tab. While on Sundays, they&#8217;re fresh from repentance in church.</p>
<p>Copacabana is a quick eight km drive from the border where you can dine on trout and camp on the beach for free. We&#8217;ve heard there is one ATM in town but we never found it. The exchange rate on the Bolivian side is much better than on the Peruvian side.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>EXCHANGE RATE (as of 9/24/11):</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">$1 US = 6.96 Bolivianos</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">1 Peruvian Sole = 2.51 Bolivianos</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">This information is free and we encourage recirculation, we only ask for a shout-out to PanAmNotes.com.<br />
Please email with any questions or corrections: &#117;&#115;&#064;&#097;&#103;&#114;&#111;&#111;&#116;&#115;&#046;&#099;&#111;&#109;.</p>

<p>The climate in Arequipa was spectacular. We enjoyed the sun while watching the first Husker&#8217;s game of the season live via wifi (GBR!). We explored the city and made plans to celebrate Logan&#8217;s day. There are so many options in Arequipa <strong>it was hard to choose how we would get our hearts pumping</strong>. Mountain climbing, river running, trekking, mountain biking, it all sounded good. In the end, Logan couldn&#8217;t resist mountain biking nearby <strong>Volcano Misti.</strong></p>

<p>Our heart rates sufficiently accelerated, we finished the day in true Logan style: <strong>debating the next big exploration over wood fired pizza and shots of Jack Daniels to carry us home</strong>. We hung around Arequipa longer than planned, soaking up the friendly atmosphere and the warm temperature. We agreed this city was the perfect combination of Cusco and Lima. Arequipa is a big city with a small town vibe and there&#8217;s so much going on here, it&#8217;s easy to feel like the only gringo around.</p>
<p>After Arequipa, we backtracked to Colca Canyon making a second stop at one of our favorite bush camps outside Chivay, Peru. We arrived at Cruz del Condor in the late afternoon and had the twice-as-deep-as-the-grand-cayon view all to ourselves. Early morning is said to be the best time to view the condors who make their home in the canyon. After setting up camp we realized there were about a dozen zooming overhead and <strong>our private viewing became even more spectacular</strong>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Our trip through South America has been all Andes save for the occasional visit to our old friend, the Pacific Ocean.  Despite our suspension airbag deterioration, we decided a stopover in the Amazon Rainforest, via the Manu Road, was in order.</p>
<div id="attachment_2181" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/ManuMap.gif" rel="shadowbox[sbpost-2169];player=img;" title="Map of Manu National Park, Peru"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2181 " title="Map of Manu National Park, Peru" src="https://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/ManuMap-300x297.gif" alt="" width="300" height="297" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The far western arm of the Amazon</p></div>
<p>Months ago, when crossing into Peru at the furthest east border crossing, we were in the Amazon Basin, but there was no forest to be seen.  Manu National Park, because of it&#8217;s past isolation and more recently it&#8217;s inclusion in the UNESCO World Heritage List, now boasts the title: <strong>worlds most biodiverse area.</strong>  This small protected chunk of the rainforest is home to a host of yet-to-be discovered species and un-contacted tribes.<strong></strong></p>
<p>We approached the park from Cusco, crossing over a 13,000 foot mountain pass before dropping down into the jungle.  Topping out at the Tres Cruces viewpoint revealed clouds as far as the eye could see.</p>
<div id="attachment_2172" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/IMG_9016.jpg" rel="shadowbox[sbpost-2169];player=img;" title="Clouded View"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2172" title="Clouded View" src="https://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/IMG_9016-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">What a rainforest looks like from above</p></div>
<div id="attachment_2171" style="width: 730px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/IMG_9015.jpg" rel="shadowbox[sbpost-2169];player=img;" title="The Jungle at 13k'"><img class="size-full wp-image-2171 " title="The Jungle at 13k'" src="https://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/IMG_9015.jpg" alt="" width="720" height="481" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Blind Curve Ahead</p></div>
<p>After a bush camp on the pass, we were winding our way down muddy tracks into the jungle, dropping nearly 8,000 feet in a day.  Our surroundings turned <strong>increasingly green and lush with each switchback.</strong>  After our descent, we continued through rock tunnels and under waterfalls gushing over the road (free car wash!).</p>
<div id="attachment_2173" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/IMG_9030.jpg" rel="shadowbox[sbpost-2169];player=img;" title="Accessing Manu"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2173 " title="Accessing Manu" src="https://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/IMG_9030-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Access to the jungle via mud and rocky tunnels</p></div>
<div id="attachment_2174" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/IMG_9052.jpg" rel="shadowbox[sbpost-2169];player=img;" title="Jungle Camp"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2174" title="Jungle Camp" src="https://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/IMG_9052-300x286.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="286" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Jungle Camping</p></div>
<p>The conditions slowed us considerably so we opted for our first jungle bush camp and set out to explore via foot.  <strong>Jumping out of the truck we were swarmed with large curious insects</strong>.  Seemingly bored with humans, they left as quickly as they came, but not before one could take a chunk out of my arm.</p>
<p>We walked around the lush forest crawling with life.  Spotting a number of odd plants and animals, we unfortunately couldn&#8217;t name a single one.  So we made up names such as the vintage metallic couch-patterned hummingbird.</p>
<p>We ventured out a second time to experience the jungle on a moonless night.  Our headlamps revealed wildlife desperately escaping the spotlight. We caught a glimpse here and there but the true marvel was the physical feeling all around us, a thriving ecosystem, an independent pulse. Afterward, we settled into the camper and fell asleep to the foreign sounds of the amazon enveloping us.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It is market day in Ollantaytambo, Peru and Logan has decided he will not accompany me this time around.  Unable to ascertain my reasons for the pinprick of anxiety over the prospect of this solo venture, I respond indifferently, “That’s fine, I’ll be right back.” I toss the cloth sack over my shoulder with <strong>strained nonchalance</strong>.</p>
<p>Seasoned travelers often encouraged us to seek out town markets in Central America, proclaiming their superior quality and economic benefits. We didn’t yet understand the draw of the municipal market. There were supermarkets with <strong>posted prices</strong> and <strong>thrice washed bagged lettuce</strong> to be had beneath the comfort of <strong>fluorescent lighting</strong>. Venture into the musty shadows of the municipal market? You must be crazy.</p>
<div id="attachment_2137" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Mainland-Mexico-033.jpg" rel="shadowbox[sbpost-2136];player=img;" title="Wally World"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2137" title="Wally World" src="https://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Mainland-Mexico-033-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Less than $1 for a tub of honeydew back in Mexico</p></div>
<p>Tattered flip flops sound my presence on the cobblestone streets and I’m greeted merrily by every one I pass up. <em>Why am I walking so fast?</em> The market comes into view. A large, cement building with dozens of stalls, <strong>colorful wears, colorful people</strong>, lighted only by open doorways and the occasional gap in the roof. I take note of my increased heart rate. <em>Deep breath.</em> It’s only the market.</p>
<p>We found our <strong>road rhythm</strong> somewhere in Colombia and with measured confidence we ventured further off the beaten track. There were no apples stamped with Fuji stickers to be found in these dirt road towns. No perfectly saran wrapped meat to sustain the red visage we recognize as fresh. We found ourselves thrust into the market scene out of necessity. And we’ve never looked back.</p>
<div id="attachment_2138" style="width: 210px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/IMG_0128.jpg" rel="shadowbox[sbpost-2136];player=img;" title="Chachapoyas Market"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2138" title="Chachapoyas Market" src="https://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/IMG_0128-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Colorful, chaotic, market day</p></div>
<p>Dozens of faces angle toward me with anticipation, my position as an outsider is evident. Shabby jeans and long red hair pull a sharp contrast to the vibrantly patterned petticoats and thickly braided tresses. It’s an exhilarating experience every single time. I’m inundated with offers the moment I step inside.</p>
<p><em>Senorita, venga a ver a mis paltas!</em><br />
(Miss, come see my avocadoes!)</p>
<p><em>Senorita, aqui, aqui!</em><br />
(Miss, come here, come here!)</p>
<p><em>Mamacita!</em><br />
(Little mama!)</p>
<p><em>Gringita bonita, tengo duraznos deliciosa!</em><br />
(Pretty little gringa, I have delicious peaches!)</p>
<p>I can’t explain why, but the lively old women who call me <strong>mamacita</strong> win me over every time. When they see I’ve decided on their stall, their eyes light up with a curious mix of mischief and relief. A grandmother, maybe a great-grandmother. Her face is deeply tanned and <strong>her eyes sparkle, crinkling around the edges displaying years of laughter in a single smile.</strong></p>
<p>The urge to pick one of everything is great. Huge avocados that seem ready to burst and tender tomatoes so juicily red I can barely contain my greedy fingers. “Cuanto cuesta?” (how much?) I ask as casually as I can muster, testing the weight of the avocado in my hand. There it is again. That mischievous <strong>twinkle</strong>. She is measuring her own cavalier demeanor with care when she responds “dos soles,” and her eyes dart up to meet my own.</p>
<div id="attachment_2139" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/IMG_0133.jpg" rel="shadowbox[sbpost-2136];player=img;" title="One of Everything Please"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2139" title="One of Everything Please" src="https://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/IMG_0133-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Green beans, don&#39;t mind if I do</p></div>
<p>I’m certain I’ve coughed up the gringa price more than once on this trip to the market. But at the inflated price of 50 centavos ($0.17 US) for a head of lettuce, the cost for my foreign status, I’m more than happy to oblige. <strong>Shopping at the town markets is something we should have done from the start.</strong> It helps the local producers, our cultural immersion, and pocketbooks on both sides.</p>
<p>Leaving the market with my overstuffed sack of groceries, I know I’m not alone. I share a secret smile with the ladies I’ve done business with this morning. <strong>We both privately thrill in our triumph</strong>, she pockets her coins with satisfaction, and I tear into that avocado with unabashed delight.</p>

<p>Noontime would bring us to the plaza for ice cold Cusquenas in the sunshine.  Sunset brought us sundowners and heated games of Apples to Apples.</p>
<p><strong>It was glorious.</strong></p>

<p>We spent a week catching up with old friends and making new ones.  Each day started with good intentions of errands to be run and laundry to be cleaned.  Each following day was our supposed departure.  Instead the mornings were filled with<strong> coffee talk, the exchange of camping spots, mechanics with reputations to be sworn by, and GPS maps</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div>Afternoons and evenings were reserved for BBQ bonfires and intercultural exchange.  As if we weren’t even in Peru, we learned about the Swiss’ black Santa (who will beat you with a stick!), the proper etiquette at an Argentinean asado, and why genuine German schnapps isn’t to be taken lightly.</div>

<p><em>Round Three</em>: After a trip through the Sacred Valley and the Amazon Jungle we show up with the intentions to stay for only a hot shower and the night.  New old friends and old new friends were just arriving. <strong>On repeat, we leave almost a week later.</strong></p>
