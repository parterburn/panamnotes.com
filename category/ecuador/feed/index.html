<p>After nearly a week in Vilcabamba Ecuador catching up with friends and planning our route through Peru, we head to the remote border crossing at La Balsa.  <del></del>La Balsa sits on one side of the Río Blanco, connecting Ecuador and Peru via a bridge (a raft once ferried passengers across, hence the name La Balsa).  The crossing was established after Ecuador and Peru settled their border differences in 1999, ending the longest-running international armed conflict in the Western Hemisphere.  It is the furthest inland crossing and <strong>by far the least frequented</strong>.</p>
<p>We set out from Vilcabamba at 11:00am hoping to camp before the crossing.  The road turned immediately to dirt and we grinned in anticipation of the off-road journey ahead.  As the narrow road climbed, the mountainous views became increasingly picturesque.  Often rocky and rough, our Bronco camper decided to ditch a hitch cover and light cover in protest.   <strong>We drove to South America to seek out the experience unfolding before us.</strong></p>
<div id="attachment_1612" style="width: 210px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/IMG_0046.jpg" rel="shadowbox[sbpost-1610];player=img;" title="Now with only one camper light"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1612 " title="Now with only one camper light" src="http://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/IMG_0046-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Roadside Attraction</p></div>
<p>We pass though Zumba, a dirt road mecca, and locate camp for the night.  Before settling down for a bacon and egg dinner, we relax next to the rocky stream as the camper breathes a sigh of relief.  We hit the hay early eager for the morning to bring even more majestic scenery and a <strong>new country</strong>.  A riverside bush camp this evening is a perfect end to our exploits in Ecuador.</p>
<div id="attachment_1637" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Bush-Camp.jpg" rel="shadowbox[sbpost-1610];player=img;" title="Last stop in Ecuador"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1637" title="Last stop in Ecuador" src="http://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Bush-Camp-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Bush camping by the river in Zumba Ecuador</p></div>
<p>At this point in the trip breaking up camp is second nature, replacing our previous morning routine of excessive snooze button hitting and a one minute shower before bolting out of the door to catch the 44.  This morning, after coffee at sunrise, we break up camp, brush our teeth, and wind our way toward Peru.</p>
<p>We arrive at the border and in 10 minutes we are checked out of Ecuador.  We interrupt a card game to change our remaining dollars (the official currency of Ecuador since 2000) into Peruvian Soles, before crossing the modest international bridge.  The shirtless Ecuadorian shopkeeper gave us a favorable rate at first offer &#8211; no haggling necessary.</p>
<div id="attachment_1615" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/IMG_0085.jpg" rel="shadowbox[sbpost-1610];player=img;" title="Into Peru"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1615" title="Into Peru" src="http://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/IMG_0085-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Crossing into Peru</p></div>
<p>Entering Peru was similarly easy.  A few questions here, a copy there and PanAmNotes is <strong>officially checked into country number eleven</strong>.</p>
<p>Our first impressions of Peru are positive, as they often are when we find ourselves in the remote countryside.  It is coffee harvest season and the farmers are drying the beans on any flat surface they can find. This includes the road. The sun is out, <strong>the earth is a vibrant green</strong>; children are again pointing and waving as their parents try to make sense of a rolling house with California plates.</p>
<div id="attachment_1638" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/River-Crossing.jpg" rel="shadowbox[sbpost-1610];player=img;" title="River Crossing"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1638" title="River Crossing" src="http://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/River-Crossing-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The beast pulls the unwilling camper through another water crossing</p></div>
<p>After a few wrong turns remedied by helpful locals, we camp in San Ignacio for the night.  Total cost for camping: s/3.00 ($1).  As luck would have it, our friends George and Andrea arrive at the same campsite with our missing hitch cover, inexplicably found along the dirt road.  Later that night we toast our new Peruvian cervezas together over Comida Chifa (Chinese food).</p>
<div id="attachment_1647" style="width: 210px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Peru.jpg" rel="shadowbox[sbpost-1610];player=img;" title="The road to Peru"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1647" title="The road to Peru" src="http://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Peru-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Our first look at Peru&#39;s winding eastern highway</p></div>
<p>We&#8217;ve been in Peru for less than 12 hours and can already tell we are going to love it here.</p>
<p><em><strong>Tips for those of you looking to use the La Balsa Border crossing:</strong></em></p>
<ol>
<li>Their is a gas station in Zumba Ecuador, but like most of Southern Ecuador it is occasionally (if not often) dry. Further, near the border, Ecuador rations their fuel to prevent foreign nationals crossing the border and filling up on $1.50/gal gasoline.  We were not restricted with how much we could purchase, but have been warned that others have.  <strong>Top off in Loja</strong> before Vilcabamba.</li>
<li>Vilcabamba to Zumba river camp took us 6 hours, an additional 1.5 hours to La Balsa</li>
<li>Zumba river camp: S04 53.59 W79 07.65</li>
<li>To exit Ecuador: get your passport stamped at immigration and hand over  your vehicle permit to Aduana who will check your VIN and license number.  Cost: $0</li>
<li>The Peruvian side closes for lunch which is typically 12:00 &#8211; 3:00pm, but can be as late as 4:00pm</li>
<li>To enter Peru: get your passport stamped in the brown building toward your right as you cross the bridge.  Cost: $0 Whether or not you&#8217;ll need copies of anything to get a vehicle permit depends on the agent.  There is a copy place next door.</li>
<li>You&#8217;ll need auto insurance to drive in Peru.  They do not sell it at the borders.  The police in Peru seem friendly, but well aware of this fact.</li>
<li>La Balsa to San Ignacio took us 1.5 hours, San Ignacio to Jaen took 2.5 hours.</li>
<li>Camp/secure parking in San Ignacio at Hostal Faical: S 05 08.711  W79 00.428</li>
<li>San Ignacio is a nicer place to stay compared to Jaén</li>
<li>UPDATE: In Southern Peru we&#8217;ve been pulled over for failing to run our headlights during daylight hours. While we don&#8217;t believe this to be a law, you might as well turn on your lights to avoid the stop and 30min conversation.</li>
</ol>

<p>30 kilometers east of Guayaquil a gray Peugeot whizzed past us, honking madly, the men inside waving their arms wildly and smiling from ear to ear. This was our introduction to Antonio, Javier, and David, three bothers with an incredible affection for one another, and the cousins of our visitors, Antony and Laurie. Rather than offering convoluted instructions on how to reach their neighborhood they drove out to meet us and guide us through the city.</p>
<p>Tannia and Patty opened their beautiful homes to us and made us feel like honorary primos. We were treated to a tour of the family&#8217;s banana plantation, the beautifully restored Malecon,  an iguana park in the middle of the bustling city, and a trip to Salinas (Guayaquil&#8217;s very own South Beach) for sun and ceviche. After each full day of sightseeing, the family gathered in the evening for lively discussion and a download of the day&#8217;s events.</p>
<p>Although the cousins speak better English than we do Spanish, we did our best to participate in conversations and found this was the most rewarding form of practice. For the first time we had to push ourselves outside of the present. We needed to explain our past lives and our future desires. This was by far the most challenging language hurdle we&#8217;ve jumped yet.  Knowing we could be put on the spot at the dinner table with a question about cattle ranching in Nebraska or our favorite aspects of San Francisco kept us on our toes.</p>
<div id="attachment_1580" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/IMG_9689.jpg" rel="shadowbox[sbpost-1560];player=img;" title="The Carrera Banana Plantation"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1580 " title="The Carrera Banana Plantation" src="http://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/IMG_9689-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The Carrera Banana Plantation</p></div>
<div id="attachment_1581" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/IMG_9704.jpg" rel="shadowbox[sbpost-1560];player=img;" title="Iguana Park "><img class="size-medium wp-image-1581 " title="Iguana Park " src="http://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/IMG_9704-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">City traffic is only a few feet away</p></div>
<p>As we pulled away from the cousins neighboring houses we agreed, Guayaquil was easily our favorite city so far. We were spoiled with all the creature comforts one starts to miss on the road &#8211; a reliably hot shower, home cooked meals, and the warmth of friends and family. But more importantly, we saw Guayaquil through the eyes of a local and as a result understood this city better than any other we have visited. You will not find Guayaquil on any recommended itinerary for travelers.  Described as hot, noisy, and chaotic, Lonely Planet recommends anti-city  travelers steer clear. Perhaps a good reminder that a guidebook is just a guide. This stop was entirely unique to the experience, specifically the incredible people and the distinct perspective they gave us.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At 13,000 feet, even this close to the equator, the thin air chills you to the bone.  We are sipping rich hot chocolate, our frozen toes propped up on the fireplace at the lodge in Cajas National Park, west of Cuenca Ecuador.  As it often does, the conversation turns to the route ahead: Peru, Bolivia, Las Pampas, and Patagonia.  This is easily our most anticipated leg of the journey.</p>
<p>Before our hands are warmed by the fire, it has been decided &#8211; <strong>we are going to extend the trip</strong>.  The timing will allow us to spend summer in the Southern Hemisphere and return to the Mid-West in the spring.  We agree on March 15th.</p>
<div id="attachment_1565" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/IMG_0106.jpg" rel="shadowbox[sbpost-1564];player=img;" title="The road to Chachapoyas"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1565" title="The road to Chachapoyas" src="http://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/IMG_0106-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">We could get used to this</p></div>
<p>The logistics behind the decision are still forthcoming.  Financially we are in the same spot we were with a January end date.  We have found no secret treasure chest among the Chachapoyas ruins, although legend has it there is one for the taking.</p>
<p>Living slowly has become our mantra and slowing the pace will cut costs.  Racing through Central America had us craving a long term stop. Finding work at a hostel or volunteering for an extended time would benefit us mentally and financially.  However, jobs abroad are hard to secure and nearly all volunteer opportunities require payment above and beyond the cost of room and board(!).  The one &#8220;free&#8221; volunteer project we researched was teaching english to politically active communists in order to make them more effective campaigners.  Not exactly our three cups of tea.</p>
<p>Much like declaring our plan to drive to Patagonia, making and stating the goal is half the battle.  What started out as a nine month pipe dream has now evolved into a 15 month soul-searching quest.</p>
<p>We have been at it for nearly six months now.  In that time there has been bloodshed, tears, and even a metal sliver imbedded in a cornea.  We have met friends we will never forget and shared countless laughs together.  So far our biggest take-away is <strong>the value in letting go</strong>. And we&#8217;re just getting started.</p>

<p>We had our pictures, we had our post cards, and even a hand-painted Peruvian flute among other gift shop knick knacks. Now all we needed were cocktails and some good old fashioned catching up. Enter the Quito police force, in full effect this Friday evening.</p>
<p>Nothing about the fourth and final police interaction felt legitimate. The face mask clad officer had our papers and led us down a shady, deserted alley. Our limited Spanish and his nonexistent English grew heated but in the end we burned $80 on threat of citation and vehicle impound for two days. Our request for a receipt was apparently very humorous.</p>
<div id="attachment_1538" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/IMG_9671.jpg" rel="shadowbox[sbpost-1531];player=img;" title="Stuck in the law breakers lot"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1538 " title="Stuck in the law breakers lot" src="http://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/IMG_9671-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">For driving on Friday with a license plate ending in 7: a police escort to this all inclusive dirt parking lot until 7:30PM</p></div>
<p>Lost reservations, unfriendly faces at the hotel, and excessive bar surcharges had us feeling very unwelcome here. We decided to escape the city limits at first light but Quito would have the last laugh. Our GPS had a two hour conniption fit attempting to get us out of the most jumbled city infrastructure known to man.</p>
<p>And then there was Baños. And all was right with the world. Arriving on Saturday was perfect, the town was hopping and we were ready to jump in on the action.We started the evening with $1.50 tall boys and foosball with the locals. Much later we had our first encounter with aguardiente in the form of flaming Bob Marley shots. The few pictures we managed to snap are not family friendly in the least, so we&#8217;ll just leave you knowing we had a ball in Baños and forgot all about Quito.</p>
