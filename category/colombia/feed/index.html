				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Lonely Planet describes the colonial city of Popayan as having more style than Bogota, Cartagena, and Medellin combined. Our expectations were high, yet an hour after entering the city limits something just wasn’t right about this place. The ultimate logic behind our decision eluded us as we hit the highway in search of a place outside the city.</p>
<div id="attachment_1446" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/IMG_9513.jpg" rel="shadowbox[sbpost-1445];player=img;" title="Camping outside Popayan"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1446 " title="Camping outside Popayan" src="https://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/IMG_9513-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">This looks good</p></div>
<p>We set up camp among the trees of an ecological preserve and marveled at the beauty surrounding us only two kilometers out of town. We read by the lake for the few hours before sunset and later broke bread with the Seventh Day Adventists who ran the place. Unknowingly, we had stumbled into their religious retreat, but they were more than happy to host us.</p>
<div id="attachment_1448" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/IMG_9518.jpg" rel="shadowbox[sbpost-1445];player=img;" title="That's a weird sign"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1448" title="That's a weird sign" src="https://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/IMG_9518-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Jesus says: If you can believe, all is possible</p></div>
<p>Our hasty retreat from Popayan is not a unique occurrence in our travels. Large cities rarely appear on our list of favorite stops. Popayan was sure to provide excellent museums, quaint colonial squares, and a hopping nightlife, but this amusement no longer sustains us. We now  find it difficult to lose ourselves in organized chaos.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> </span></p>
<p>From the nightlife to the art scene to the people to the music to the  wide variety of performing arts, the city is a limitless playground. No  matter the time or the place, there is bound to be something happening,  something you won&#8217;t want to miss, playing itself out on the city stage. Think Disneyland for adults, complete with long lines and overpriced drinks.</p>
<div id="attachment_1453" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/IMG_9388.jpg" rel="shadowbox[sbpost-1445];player=img;" title="Lovely"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1453" title="Lovely" src="https://panamnotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/IMG_9388-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Endless green</p></div>
<p>City living required we attack each weekend with hungry enthusiasm because come Monday morning, those 48 hours somehow yielded the identity we struggled to maintain. We started this journey to break the cycle, hoping to build a stronger relationship with the  passions we rarely had time for in our city of distraction.</p>
<p>When you strip away the diversion, the amusement, what you are left with &#8211; <a href="http://www.coldsplinters.com/2010/07/walden/" target="_blank"><strong>the simplicity of life</strong></a> &#8211; is astounding. The amount of personal joy one can attain in the simple act of living is liberating. When your fundamental needs are minimized, life is inevitably maximized. A non-urban setting allows for a more honest self-evaluation where we can be more in tune with ourselves, less on display for others.</p>
<p>We are new to this. Short of Walden, our days in nature are supported by the big box grocery stores in town and Exxon Mobile&#8217;s oil extraction in the Amazon Basin. We are not perfect, we are learning, we are making mistakes, we are striving to live better.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>With your choice of camper, it&#8217;s not a matter of <strong>if </strong>it will break, but <strong>when</strong>.</p></blockquote>
<p>Before leaving,we were additionally warned against mounting the jerrycan on the rear because <em>bandits </em>will shoot at it to blow up the truck. The travel advice rendered from most Americans more closely resembles guidance for surviving an apocalyptic zombie wasteland.</p>
<p>Even in regard to destinations the prevailing theme is avoidance. We were told that if we managed to <strong>survive </strong>the Mexican border zone, Nicaragua or Colombia would surely be our ultimate demise. We found ourselves half agreeing with the misguided tips and held our breath as we crossed borders and moved deeper into Central America.</p>
<p>Suddenly we are in Colombia, South America. Complete strangers flash broad smiles at our gringo gear and stop whatever they are doing to engage us in friendly conversation. &#8220;NorteAmericanos! Welcome to my country! Welcome to Colombia!&#8221; They want to know how many kilometers we have traveled, where we are going next, and what the heck California plates are doing on the South American continent. The travel books will tell you &#8220;the friendliest people&#8221; live in every town. We have found this overused statement to be one hundred percent true in Colombia.</p>
<p>The warm welcome of the nation&#8217;s people is matched only by it&#8217;s superb countryside. Lush green valleys dip between massive hillsides and waterfalls cascade toward the PanAmerican at every bend. <strong>The fertile land is so rich in color and vibrancy, the greatest danger is keeping our focus on the road.</strong></p>

<p>Colombia, like the rest of the countries we were warned against, has turned out to be a highlight of the trip. The country has a storied past and their worldwide reputation plays a role in the eager to please attitude toward foreigners. If you really want to see Colombia at it&#8217;s best, <strong>visit now</strong>. In 25 years it will be chock full of all-inclusive resorts and gated communities. This stunningly beautiful nation we initially planned to skip is quickly earning a spot on the &#8220;must return to&#8221; list.</p>

<p>The Darien Gap is a 100 mile stretch of <a title="FARC" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolutionary_Armed_Forces_of_Colombia" target="_blank">FARC</a> infested swampland dividing Panama and Colombia. The last successful overland vehicle crossing of this road-less wonder was completed in 741 days between 1985 and 1987. Did you catch that? <strong>Two years to travel 100 miles. </strong>Lacking unlimited time, we opted for a cargo ship which would haul our truck around the gap in just 24 hours.</p>
<p>What we assumed would be a $1000, one week ordeal transformed into a one month non-inclusive ($) course on Latin American Business Practices. The curriculum included Language Clarification (yes means maybe and no mean perhaps), Specialized Accounting for Budget Oversights, and Advanced Time Management with an emphasis in Official Stamp Accumulation.</p>
<p><strong>A detailed rundown of the process would only be a painful rendering of a string of unexciting let downs. </strong>We could go on for days about the ups and downs but really we&#8217;re just happy it&#8217;s over. And even more so, we are thrilled to be in South America. Once again, we have all our needs in the back of the pick up and all our desires laid out in the freedom of the open road ahead.</p>
<p>Special thanks go out to a few special people:</p>
<ul>
<li>Shaun at <a href="http://www.panamapassage.com/" target="_blank">Panama Passage</a> for giving us a home away from home and being a valued member of the Squeeze Team</li>
<li> Julio at <a href="http://www.panamasolucioneslogisticas.com/index_en.html" target="_blank">PSLI</a> for &#8220;making it happen&#8221;</li>
<li>Antonio in Cartagena for translating &#8220;absolutely not&#8221; into &#8220;ok, go ahead&#8221;</li>

<p>We opted against creating a guide for shipping the gap because we wouldn´t wish our situation on any other traveler. We did however throw together some helpful tips to potentially avoid the problems we encountered:</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sunday morning in Cartagena Colombia. We decide an early start is in order as we hope to accomplish <del datetime="2011-05-22T18:26:14+00:00">something </del>anything of value on what should be (but is not) our last free day in this little city. Having spent more time here than we originally planned, our frustrations over the loss of control in this journey have settled around us like a thick cloak, heavy with negativity. But this is no place for extra layers and we are determined to shake it off and enjoy the benefits of delayed gratification.</p>
<p>We make our way through Getsemani, only a few blocks from the charming colonial streets of Cartagena&#8217;s walled city. At first glance, our place of semi-permanent residence appears to be a filthy and dangerous haven for shady characters and backpackers alike. Yet we find the real heart of Cartagena in the shadowy nooks of Getsemani. <strong>Fancy restaurant fronts neighbor buildings in total ruin.</strong> Furtive glances through open doorways reveal unembarrassed family rooms where elderly women fan themselves in rocking chairs, eyes glued intently on the telenovela. The sounds rarely cease, vibrant Caribbean reggae beats drift and mingle with the occasional slot machine payout and the almost rhythmic consistency of the cab drivers and their horns.</p>

<p>As we sleepily make our way through the neighborhood at 8AM we cannot help noticing the startling quiet. Vacant streets and sidewalks are eerily peaceful. Shopkeepers open their doors with slow, deliberate movements. Even the taxis lay still, parked and seemingly abandoned, it will be hours before they weave their orchestra of discord throughout the city. We take in the incredible silence and make our way toward the Juan Valdez coffee shop.</p>
<p>Just moments after entering the walled city we realize San Martin plaza is not where we remember leaving it. <strong>This will not be the first time we wander hopelessly in search of a place we have been before.</strong> Once again, the elusive plaza is testing the limits of our antiperspirant. When we finally stumble across our destination, the doors are shut tight and a small sign explains their closure for energy conservation. This town is full of novel ideas. They even restrict the amount of cars allowed on the road each day. Can you imagine an implementation like this in San Francisco?</p>
<p>Little moments like this remind us why we love overlanding. The sun has just barely begun it&#8217;s morning ascent and we are already bathed in sweat and on the verge of a caffeine withdrawal frenzy. Sure our truck may be locked up in a port just east of God knows where. And our shipping agent presumes &#8220;I can&#8217;t do anything about it&#8221; is an acceptable answer to all of our questions. <strong>But what&#8217;s a good road trip without  a little struggle?</strong></p>
