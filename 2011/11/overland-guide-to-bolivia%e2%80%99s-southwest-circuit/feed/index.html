		<description><![CDATA[We are one day away from starting this route, currently staying at your recommended spot in Sucre. Proud (or maybe more ashamed) to say that we&#039;re the first Americans to be here since you guys. Our hosts were excited to point that out, showing us your guestbook entry from oh-so-many months ago. 

Just wanted to say thanks for an awesome writeup on the route and all the other helpful information I&#039;ve found on your site.]]></description>
