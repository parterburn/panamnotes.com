		<description><![CDATA[So glad I found your site.  My husband and I are planning on an overland trip to Costa Rica, although we&#039;re planning on settling in Nicaragua.  We&#039;re getting a camper, because we&#039;re bringing our two elderly dogs and two cats.  That in itself will be quite an adventure.  lol. At some point we&#039;d like to continue the adventure into S.America.   We&#039;ve been getting a lot of the &quot;are you crazy?&quot; comments, but we&#039;re very excited about the adventure of it all.  It seems like it will be a very freeing experience if anything. Letting go of all the possessions that encumber us to enjoy the experience of meeting other people not afraid of letting go.  Can&#039;t wait.  We&#039;re in the process of getting rid of all our stuff at this point and hope to be on the rode sometime between this spring and next fall.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey Dani:

You&#039;ll meet a number of solo travelers, they just aren&#039;t apt to keeping up a blog.  I don&#039;t believe we met a woman traveling overland alone however.  If you make it a point to always (or almost always) stay in an organized campground, hostel, or with some other campers at least, I think the risks of going it alone wouldn&#039;t be any greater than the rest of us.

I would still choose the Tundra.  She&#039;s taken everything we&#039;ve thrown at her without any problems.  That said if I were trying to keep costs lower (Tundras aren&#039;t cheap) I would have considered taking a Ford truck with the 5.6L V8.  This engine is all over Latin America.  I myself wouldn&#039;t consider a diesel as my mechanical knowledge is all on gas.  There are a lot of opinions on the diesel vs gasoline debate, but for the PanAm I would take gasoline over diesel every time.  Just my preference.

The 4.7L V8 in the Tundra is a gas sipper.  We regularly get 16-18 MPGs which is as good as it gets with a 4x4 camper.  Because of the weight and drag you&#039;ll get the same MPGs with the V6 in the Tundra or Tacoma.

No problem finding parts for the Tundra.  Latino mechanics are very resourceful and we have had very few troubles.

We absolutely love our pop-up camper.  Because of it&#039;s convenience, safety, and amenities we&#039;ve camped around 85% of the time.  I would highly recomend you take something similar for two reasons: #1- traveling alone - camping in a camper is much saver than tent camping for a host of reasons. #2 - traveling with a dog - it is difficult to find lodging that allows pets in Latin America.  With a camper you&#039;ll always have a comfortable and reasonably safe backup.

Lastly we don&#039;t have a bathroom and we&#039;ve never felt the need for one.  I wouldn&#039;t recommend putting a camper that offers a shower and toilet on a Tundra.  It&#039;s just too much weight no matter what the salesman says.  For you I would consider purchasing a camper without one and just carrying along a cassette toilet you can use in the camper.  For a shower bring along a solar sun shower.  Both of these weight very little.

Hope this helps, feel free to keep the questions coming!]]></description>
