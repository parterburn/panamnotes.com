		<description><![CDATA[We felt the same way about Granada, but it could definitely just have been &quot;picturesque colonial city fatigue.&quot; We splurged on a cabana on the lake at Apoyo and loved it, though there wasn&#039;t much to do but dig your toes into the volcanic sand and feel the heat from below. Volcan Masaya was fun to drive up, especially in light of the recommendation that you park facing downhill in case it erupted like it had in 2008. Oh, wow, just googled it and I guess it erupted in 2012 too!

Your comment on the ebbs and flows of overlanding attitudes is right on.

		<description><![CDATA[Loved Nicaragua! Sounds like our trips were somewhat reversed. I came from (and returned via) Costa Rica. We hit San Juan del Sur first. I agree it&#039;s a fantastic and laid back little town!  Great memories, there, too, but I also liked Granada. Maybe it was because we had spent two nights on Ometepe  in between and I was just happy to be back in the city! LOL

I actually walked a good ways out of the city core, though, and I agree, Granada is like too cities. I didn&#039;t feel unsafe beyond the polished middle but there was definitely a lot less glamour spared on the locals.]]></description>
