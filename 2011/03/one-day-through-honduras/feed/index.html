		<description><![CDATA[Just crossed the border at El Amatillo to Honduras  and got scammed big time! First mistake, we took a coyote. One was very helpful crossing into El Salvador but this time around, oh boy... He started by scaring us it will take 5 hours without him and his buddy that is well connected on the Honduran side. The big problem was that we recently renewed registration of both our cars and accidently printed the one for the car that stayed in the US... Somehow this was not discovered in the crossing to El Salvador. Long story short they had us by the balls, and we ended up paying $150 more than we actually needed, for &quot;bribe&quot; which clearly in the after thought they pocketed...
Be warned!]]></description>
