		<description><![CDATA[My husband and I have a 2015 Tundra and are planning on doing the Pan American when we&#039;re finished with the army (in 6-8 years). A couple questions for you. Have you had any issues with your camper &quot;sticking with&quot; your truck? We&#039;ve been told truck bed campers like yours will rock and knock on the hood of the truck. Has this been your experience at all?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[awesome ride you guys have there! we just bought a 1991 toyota previa for $2000 and got going. we&#039;re in colombia and though we&#039;ve had some problems (like a busted brake master cylinder on day three while driving down the pacific coast highway, no a/c which we only discovered months later in arizona and a dented oil pan courtesy of a mexican topes) she&#039;s still going strong! her name is suzie wong and she&#039;s all woman! 

but yes, you guys got a great deal and i bet you sleep in your vehicle a lot more than we do (limited by climate often, but we use our tent!) and we would love if suzie was higher clearance. plus either diesel, biodiesel or veggie oil next time we embark on such a trip.

if we can ever afford it, we&#039;re going for an earthcruiser.com.au for sure .. we can dream right?

hope you have an amazing journey south and let us know if you want any info on anything, perhaps we&#039;ll cross paths at some point! i also have lots of info on shipping vehicles (which kristin at DTA has posted most of on the site).

happy trails, overlanders! xo
