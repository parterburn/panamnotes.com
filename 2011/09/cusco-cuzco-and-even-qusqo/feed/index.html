		<description><![CDATA[We didn&#039;t get any close ups unfortunately. The most interesting rig was a 4WD Mitsubishi van (model L300). We were most impressed with a 4x4 Mercedes Sprinter with the interior looking like it was designed by a Swiss interior decorator with mad organizational skills.

Those Euros, even though they pay through the teeth for them, have all kinds of options we don&#039;t have in the States. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Sweeet, we&#039;re looking forward to watching this... in Chile when the internetz are back to normal again.

You two might want to plan Bolivia as your &quot;vacation time&quot; as even La Paz internet is only slightly better than dial-up.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey guys. David Sedaris has a super funny story called &quot;6 to 8 black men&quot; about the Netherlands Santa and his helpers. Here&#039;s a YouTube link to David Sedaris telling the story. Unfortunately, the video portion is of crappy footage in what I assume to be the Netherlands. I would just close my eyes and listen to the audio. I used to have this audiobook, and I would play this story over and over again whilst stuck in LA traffic. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCUHTDrca4s]]></description>
