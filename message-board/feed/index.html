		<description><![CDATA[Hi guys, love the site and know it has long been completed. Question... sleeping bags. For all your use, outdoor and the camper, with exception on mountaineering, what degree rated bag did you use or wish you would have used?

Thanks,

Bill]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi, Just a quick question about insurance for your vehicle.  Who did you get coverage from in the US?  Does it cover you in all your travels, or did you have to get country specific coverage in each country you went to?  Can you remember how much the coverage was?

Thanks]]></description>
