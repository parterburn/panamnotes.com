		<description><![CDATA[You can legally sell such vehicle to Chilenos in Chile (but not to Argentinos in Argentina)! Takes a bit time, you need to advertise locally in Spanish, we used vivastreet.cl and had success! Good luck

		<description><![CDATA[They all tried to sell it to foreigners as selling it to residents is illegal anyway. As I remember they came from Canada, Norway, and one couple from Germany. If it works, good for you, I just haven&#039;t heard a success story beside Dan from theroadchoseme.com, but he had a hell of a time to get everything sorted out.
Would be great if you could write a post how you did it in the end. I&#039;m sure a lot of other overlanders would appreciate it.
Good luck.]]></description>
