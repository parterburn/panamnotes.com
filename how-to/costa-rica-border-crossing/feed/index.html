		<description><![CDATA[Hi,  These notes are great and saved us much time and grief crossing borders during our drive to Panama.  We crossed the Nicaragua/Costa Rica border a couple of weeks ago and it has changed a bit since this &#039;how to&#039; was written.  The Nicas have a new Immigration building which is pretty obvious but is in different location than described--it is across the parking lot from the water tower/old building and runs very smoothly.  Also, we crossed on a busy Monday and there was no fumigation upon entering CR.  I thought I missed it but it seems to be completely gone.  Don&#039;t forget to hit the duty free shop--5 bottles of Flor de Cana for $35 USD!    STB]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Great information, however I think you meant to type Costa Rica insurance must be paid in Colones not cordobas. Also no need to pay for forms (you tipped for 5 cordobas) they are free from the officials. Border crossings are always anxiety  provoking so excellent idea to have these &quot;how to notes&quot; for border crossings. ]]></description>
